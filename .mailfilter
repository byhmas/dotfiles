# if spam gets into my inbox I move it the spamassasin maildir
# why not go straight to sa-learn? because usually I am not reading mail from my server.
# therefore I would be piping into wrong machine's spamassasin...

# every now and then I goto spamassasin folder to look at the catch
# I train the bayesian filter, and god forbid if I find HAM I make sure sa knows about it!
