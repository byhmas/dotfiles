00:00 <@NoVisAnima> are you trying to accuse *me*
00:03 <+Nana`> what do you think
00:04 <@NoVisAnima> i think you're being cheeky
00:05 <@NoVisAnima> i'm innocent
00:05 <+Nana`> whatever
00:05 <@NoVisAnima> O_O
00:07 <@NoVisAnima> *mutter* *mutter* you're mean *mutter* *mutter*
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> *giggles*
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> i'm in a far too good mood, ok so i didn't get much work done, but i've half written my review of the year.
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> It's made me feel all good inside
00:09 <+Nana`> review of the year?
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> yeah, since this year hasn't sucked like the ones before it
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> i've actually got things worthwhile remembering in it
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> so i'm just writing them down
00:21 -!- nana|blog [legato@modem-765.bonobo.dialup.pol.co.uk] has joined #buncs
00:21 -!- mode/#buncs [+v nana|blog] by NoVisAnima
00:21 -!- nana|blog is now known as nana-
00:22 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
00:22 -!- Nana` [legato@modem-4061.gazelle.dialup.pol.co.uk] has quit [Ping timeout]
00:30 <@NoVisAnima> oh
00:30 <@NoVisAnima> small FYI
00:30 <@NoVisAnima> flo has discovered that he legally cant get back into his own country because his id card has run out
00:30 <@Krypt0n> LOL
00:30 <+nana-> nooooooo
00:31 <+nana-> make him go away
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> oh he can leave
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> just when he lands
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> we think either a) he'll have to wait around for a card
00:31 <@Krypt|LpTp> flo stuck in the UK all xmas, on his own... ohh dear
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> b) get taken by german police and locked up
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> c) get a fine
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> he can leave the country cos all he needs is his passport
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> it's the getting out of the air port the other end
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> ~:D
00:32 <@Krypt0n> hmm
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> apparently it takes 6 weeks to get a new card
00:33 -!- aeronicc [~aeronic@213.249.223.77] has quit [Signed off]
00:40 <@NoVisAnima> hmm, maybe i should go for an early night
00:40 <@NoVisAnima> so i'm more awake tomorrow
00:41 <+nana-> what's tomorrow
00:41 <@NoVisAnima> sunday
00:41 <+nana-> well duh
00:41 <@NoVisAnima> exactly my point
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> with more awakedness i can get more work done over a greater period of time
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> rather than spending the time in a dream like state the entire time
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> which helps when i'm thinking about the solutions to problems, but doesn't help in their implementation
00:43 <+nana-> i have figured out how to do lisp
00:43 <+nana-> it's just a case of doingit tomorrow
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> lisp isn't *too* bad ~:P
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> it could be worse
00:44 <@NoVisAnima> pity i ended up doing it all in the last moments, in truth i almost didn't get any of it done
00:45 <@NoVisAnima> hmm, my work pattern has actually been the same as last year, though this time they understand me
00:46 <+nana-> i dreamt about zombies the other day
00:46 <+nana-> i dreamt a zombie was going to eat me
00:46 <+nana-> and i was trying to reason with him and saying "look, i know you have a heartbeat jsut for fun,but i *really* need mine...would you mind not biting me?"
00:46 <+nana-> and i went to shake hands with this zombie
00:47 <+nana-> and it bit me
00:48 <@NoVisAnima> what colour was the zombie?
00:48  * Krypt|LpTp considers finding dinner
00:48 <@draq> Kamakaze: lo?
00:48 <@NoVisAnima> LOL
00:49 <+nana-> I dont know
00:49 <+nana-> person coloured
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> i was just thinking
00:53 <+nana-> shaaaaaakeaawayyyy pwnz
00:54 <@NoVisAnima> indeed they do, but i really haven't been enough times
00:54 <@NoVisAnima> i dont spend enough time in town
