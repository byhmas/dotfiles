17:42 <@NoVisAnima> and then is that all your cwk done (except jade)?
17:42 <+NanakiXII> no
17:42 <+NanakiXII> lisp
17:42 <@NoVisAnima> ick, i'd forgotten about that
17:43 <@NoVisAnima> hopefully that wont be too bad
17:49 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
17:50 <+NanakiXII> woo
17:50 <+NanakiXII> soudns like you had a nice day
17:50 <@NoVisAnima> yup, i've got all perked up and am going to be able to get stuff done
17:51 <@NoVisAnima> just got to keep reminding myself *not* to wander into town to watch that film again...
17:52 <@NoVisAnima> though there could be an organised trip to see it after cwk maybe?
17:55 <@NoVisAnima> ~:D
17:55 <@NoVisAnima> flo still thinks that he doesn't need to bother with a lit review
17:55 <+NanakiXII> ha ha ha @ him
17:55 <+NanakiXII> but knowing the smug german gitthat he is he will probably get away with it
17:56  * NanakiXII is 'stremely cold
17:56 <@NoVisAnima> close the window?
17:56 <+NanakiXII> it isnt open
17:56  * NanakiXII does osaka thumb pose *eyaaaayyy*
17:56 <@NoVisAnima> ^_^
17:57 <+NanakiXII> anyway i only came on here to get a paper
17:57 <@NoVisAnima> heh
17:57 <@NoVisAnima> nice to know you're getting on well, gl with the rest of it ~:)
18:02 <+|31770|> anyone see whats wrong with this http://www.bath.ac.uk/~cs2om/login.phps
18:03 <+|31770|> errors on line 10 :/
18:03 <@Kamakaze> you have an s
18:03 <+NanakiXII> heh
18:03 <+NanakiXII> surely the extension should be .php or .php3
18:03 <+|31770|> lol i know theres an s its so u can see the code
18:04 <+|31770|> it gives parse error online 10 when its .php
18:04 <@Kamakaze> ok
18:04 <+NanakiXII>  mysql_query('SELECT count(User_ID) FROM tblCustomer WHERE Email_address LIKE $input_email);
18:04 <+NanakiXII> there is a mismatched '
18:04 <+NanakiXII> ad...surely it should be a string anyway
18:05 <+|31770|> ah
18:05 <@Kamakaze> yes its errors dont often indicate that something is wrong on the line given
18:05 <+NanakiXII> well in this case it kinda did
18:05 <+NanakiXII> because there was an error assigning $userCount
18:06 <+|31770|> well that moved the error to line 11
18:06 <@Kamakaze> there was a parse error
18:06 <@Kamakaze> on the line with a ' in
18:06 <@Kamakaze> on line 10 there was another '
18:06 <@Kamakaze> which ended the string and made everything else wrong
18:06 <+NanakiXII> you've got another mismatched '
18:06 <+NanakiXII> on line 11
18:06 <@Kamakaze> }elseif (&userCount < 1 ) {
18:06 <@Kamakaze> and should that be a &
18:06 <+NanakiXII> oh no wait you havent
18:07 <+NanakiXII> and those should really be "'s anyway
18:07 <@Kamakaze> no
18:07 <@Kamakaze> they shouldnt be "
18:07 <+|31770|> cant have more then one " can u
18:07 <+NanakiXII> there's another on the $password thing
18:07 <@Kamakaze> did you copy and paste your query
18:08 <+NanakiXII> and the $_SESSION['user'] assignment
18:08 <@Kamakaze> because they all have the same problems
18:08 <+|31770|> yeh but corrected all of them now
18:08  * |31770| updates phps file
18:08 <+|31770|> ok that has those changes in
18:08 <+NanakiXII> grrr
18:08 <+NanakiXII> time to go do work

18:08 <@Kamakaze> if you are using '
18:09 <@Kamakaze> you want to do LIKE '.$input_email
18:09 <+|31770|> ok
18:10 <@Kamakaze> echo 'You have entered the incorrect password, please try again.'
18:10 <@Kamakaze> has a missing ;
18:11 <@Kamakaze> as does the other echo
18:12 <@Kamakaze> im guessing you are new at this
18:12 <+|31770|> lol yeh
18:12 <+|31770|> got to do half the php coding for the database assignment
18:13 <@Kamakaze> well mysql_query returns a record set
18:13 <+|31770|> done some html before but not php
18:13 <@Kamakaze> not just a single answer
18:13 <+|31770|> but if u restrict it doe that make a single answer?
18:13 <@Kamakaze> no
18:13 <@Kamakaze> you need to get the data from the record set
18:14 <+|31770|> how do i do that?
18:14 <@Kamakaze> mysql_fetch_array
18:14 <+|31770|> instead of query?
18:14 <@Kamakaze> so eg. $recordSet = mysql_query("SELECT name FROM people LIMIT 1")
18:14 <@Kamakaze> then $data = mysql_fetch_array($recordSet);
18:15 <@Kamakaze> then you can do this
18:15 <@Kamakaze> echo $data['name'];
18:15 <+|31770|> ok
18:19 <+|31770|> right have made some changes is that more what u need then?
18:20 <@Kamakaze> something like that
18:21 <@Kamakaze> $password['Password']
18:21 <@Kamakaze> would get the password value
18:21 <@Kamakaze> you are missing a $ off the userSet
18:22 <@Kamakaze> and it should be $user['User_ID']
18:22 <@Kamakaze> also the usercount query needs to be changed
18:22 <+|31770|> ok

18:23 -!- mode/#buncs [+v GwieF] by NoVisAnima
18:25 <+|31770|> with my 1st if : if (!$userCount) {
18:25 <+|31770|> 		die('mySQL error: '.mysql_errno().':'.mysql_error());
18:26 <+|31770|> does that need changeing because its just to reprot errors so doesnt test the value
18:26 <@Kamakaze> thats ok 
18:26 <+|31770|> thought so
18:26 <@Kamakaze> but you dont want the elseif
18:27 <+|31770|> does it want to be usercount set
18:27 <+|31770|> just anouther if statement then ?
18:27 <@Kamakaze> yes you want to get the data with a fetch array inside the else
18:27 <@Kamakaze> then you can check if the usercount is less than 1
18:28 <@Kamakaze> also you probably want to change the query so it says count(User_ID) as usercount
18:28 -!- Neil|Hungover [~br@lhstaticip22.lionhead.com] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
18:28 <@Kamakaze> so that you can access the count with $data['usercount']
18:28 <+|31770|> will that do the same thing if it says usercount
18:29 <+|31770|> ?
18:29 <+|31770|> or do i need to add a varible

18:29 -!- mode/#buncs [+v Neil|Work] by NoVisAnima
18:29 <@Kamakaze> well it doesnt matter what the variables are called
18:30 <@Kamakaze> just do what you did for the other queries with the user count ont
18:30 <@Kamakaze> one
18:31 <+|31770|> ok ive done that i think
18:32 <@Kamakaze> [count(User_ID)] 
18:32 <@Kamakaze> i dont think it will like that
18:33 <@Kamakaze> 'SELECT count(User_ID) as userCount FROM tblCustomer WHERE Email_address LIKE '.$input_email
18:33 <@Kamakaze> i would replace the first query with that
18:33 <@Kamakaze> then 
18:33 <@Kamakaze> $userCount['userCount']
18:33 <+|31770|> ah i  c
18:34 <+|31770|> ok done that but it erroring on line 18
18:35 <+|31770|> is that the session start thing
18:35 <@Kamakaze> $password[Password]
18:35 <@Kamakaze> should be
18:36 <@Kamakaze> $password['Password']
18:36 <@Kamakaze> and also you dont want to be assigning 0 to $password['Password']
18:36 <+|31770|> do i wnat to put ' around the other ones aswell
18:36 <@Kamakaze> yes
18:36 <+|31770|> == work?
18:36 <@Kamakaze> yes
18:37 <@Kamakaze> $password = mysql_fetch_array($recordSet);
18:37 <@Kamakaze> that $recordSet should be $passwordSet
18:37 <@Kamakaze> since that is what you called it
18:37 <+|31770|> yay now got to the sql errors ;)
18:52 <+Krypt|LpTp> yay (let a 1 c) => (VAR a 1)\nc

23:47 <+Nana`> yes, quite
23:48 <+Nana`> did i just say that or did you already know 
23:49 <@NoVisAnima> i recognised the layout
23:50 <+Nana`> but how did you see it before
23:51 <+Nana`> (i did an entry)
23:52 <@NoVisAnima> well just as you said you were finishing i popped there to see if i'd remembered where you said you'd put it
23:52 <@NoVisAnima> then i recognised the layout and checked the web archive to see if there was anything of the old one
23:53 <+Nana`> well i dont see how you wouldve seen nanaki.co.uk before
23:53 <+Nana`> i didnt know you when i owned that domain
23:54 <@NoVisAnima> oh you didn't know me by face
23:54 <@NoVisAnima> but i've been on *here* since the early part of the first year
23:55 <@NoVisAnima> i do remember you having that domain
23:55 <@NoVisAnima> i do remember when you had a "stalker" and moved the journal to something along the lines of "donutcomeherefagitz"
23:55 <+Nana`> oh
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> i have a rather silly memory
23:57 <+Nana`> Hm...
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> i remember little stupid facts without thinking
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> but it's the whole putting them together for any good use
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> like... exam answers
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> when things go wrong
23:58 <+Nana`> er...generally I think they'd call "remembering little facts" stalking
