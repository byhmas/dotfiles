00:15 < Alex> Where in the debian.org-web will our debian-edu pages be?
00:16 < Alex> I'm beginning to organize our pages and translate these days.
00:26 < pere> Alex: not sure.  I think stockholm have been thinking a bit about such things.
00:29 < Alex> Okay. I'll just use /education with my local copy in the mean time and get started with it.

00:46 < Alex> stockholm: I'll just get started and learn webwml locally first. :-)
00:46 < stockholm> Alex: yes, you can do that, too. 
00:51 < Alex> I prefer to do that first. :-)
