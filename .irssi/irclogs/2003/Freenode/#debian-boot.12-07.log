19:50 < vinsci> anyone with a ThinkPad R40e around? (keyboard not working for me)
19:58 < pere> what kind of keyboard is this?  USB?
19:59 < vinsci> I suspect so
19:59 < vinsci> knoppix runs, so I can drop into that and look at whatever you'd like to know
20:05 < joeyh> see what dmesg has to say about the keyboard on knoppix, I guess
20:07  * vinsci nods
20:08 -!- Jonzl [~Jonzl@dfn236108.extern.uni-tuebingen.de] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
20:14 < vinsci> hmmm, dmesg output doesn't contain the string "keyb"
20:14 < vinsci> what should I look for?
20:14 -!- Jonzl [~Jonzl@dfn236108.extern.uni-tuebingen.de] has joined #debian-boot
20:18 < vinsci> ah, btw, just realised that the keyboard work when the d-i bootloader has just started (ie I cantype linux, net or whatever), but once the kernel has booted and d-i is running, the keyboard is dead
20:28 -!- piotr [~piotr@FW-30-241.go.retevision.es] has quit [Read error: 113 (No route to host)]
20:28 < joeyh> that's very interesting..
20:28 < joeyh> er, no it's not, I misread :-)
20:28 < joeyh> just means linux is not supporting your keyboard for whatever reason
20:28 < vinsci> knppix config has CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV=m in the input core support section (2.4.22 kernel), but lsmod shows that keybdev.o isn't loaded
20:29 < vinsci> so not a usb keyboard then, I guess
20:30 < joeyh> if it's an AT or PS/2 keyboard you should see something in dmesg about it
20:30 < vinsci> the interesting part, I think, is that it works at the bootloader level, but stops working once the kernel is loaded

20:31 < joeyh> bootloader uses the bios, linux does not
20:31 < vinsci> k
20:32 < vinsci> what would dmesg say for a AT or PS/2 keyboard?
20:33 < joeyh> I forget but it says something
20:33 < joeyh> hmm, could be wrong here, maybe that is only in 2.6
20:34 < vinsci> guess so, I can't find anything
20:35 < joeyh> I wonder if you are able to use the keyboard before the frame buffer comes up
20:35 < dan_t> hello!
20:36 < vinsci> how would I check that?
20:36 -!- piotr [~piotr@FW-30-241.go.retevision.es] has joined #debian-boot
20:36 < dan_t> i'm trying d-i i'm interested into LVM config but i'm unable to make it work (i'm not a lvm expert)
20:36 < joeyh> easiest way might be to boot a floppy instead of the CD
20:37 < vinsci> don't have a floppy drive, unfortunately :)
20:37 < joeyh> what does /proc/interrupts say about your keyboard?
20:37 < vinsci> 1: 2232 XT-PIC keyboard
20:39 < joeyh> well that sounds bog standard
20:40 < joeyh> does your keyboard work in knoppix outside of X?
20:40 < vinsci> yes
20:44 < joeyh> sounds like a problem with the d-i frame buffer to me, unfortunatly there is no way to disable the frame buffer currently
20:45 < joeyh> we're going to have to add a boot option to disable it for other reasons, I dunno if you can wait for that
20:46 < vinsci> well, the sooner the better, obviously - by tuesday, I can dedicate time to it all day
20:48 < joeyh> it should not be too hard to add, but we cannot currently make new cd images
20:48 < pb_> I doubt the framebuffer driver would make a difference to the keyboard.  It's only concerned with video output.
20:49 < joeyh> not so sure
20:50 < dan_t> if i  try to config lvm in the installer i get "No usable physical volumes found" error when i try to create a new VG
20:50 < dan_t> someone cal help me ?
20:50 -!- pere is now known as pere_movie
20:50 < dan_t> i have created a new partition and make it "linux LVM" type
20:53 < joeyh> we run a terminal emulator in the frame buffer, it could easily have some keyboard related problem
20:55 < vinsci> could it be a hardware detection problem? I see that knoppix boots the kernel with a nomce argument, which prohibits some detection
20:55 < joeyh> you can try passing similar arguments to the d-i kernel from its boot loader
20:56 < vinsci> tried, didn't help
20:56 < vinsci> I can hook up a terminal to the serial port and try with the debug argument, if you think it would reveal anything
20:57 < joeyh> but really, I have never seen the linux kernel fail to detect a plain old keyboard, and the idea that one version would fail and another succeed is unlikely
20:57 < joeyh> note that most of the options listed are for the boot-floppies and do not work, except for kernel options
20:58 < vinsci> hmm, I should search the knoppix mailing lists, they've likely seen the problem already

21:05 < vinsci> no mention of thinkpad keyboard problems in the various knoppix forums
21:05 < joeyh> I'm seeing stuff about red hat not working with the keyboard in this machine

21:10 < joeyh> unfortunatly no workaround is given save a USB keyboard
21:13 < vinsci> I see the bios is date 05/26/2003, while IBM has released three later versions by now http://www-3.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-50302
