22:54 < fatal_> I tried the installer today and noticed that in the swedish translation "no" is translated incorrectly.. ;P .... it says "ney" when it's supposed to say "nej" ... pretty funny since it must have been hard to miss by the person who translated it.. ;)

23:55 < pere> gah!  apt-get and apt-cache uses different notation for the -o arguments. :(
23:55 < pere> I can't use the same argument list for both programs, when I want apt-get to fetch the lists, and apt-cache to use them. :(
