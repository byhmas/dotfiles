18:58 < waldi> parted may be better but lacks support for ibm disklabels

19:05 < dan_t> waldi: how i can search for partitions then ?
19:27 < andred> nanoprobe: Let me know when you're going to start translating. I've done a few more translations and I'm working on some others now, so I want to make sure you don't start on anything I've already done.
19:27 < nanoprobe> andred: Ok, was just about to start. Must every word be translated? Even such untransable words as 'freefat'
19:28 < waldi> freefat?
19:30 < andred> fatfree?
19:30 < nanoprobe> in tools/autopartkit/debian/po/
19:30 < nanoprobe> Haven't a clue what it is.
19:30 < andred> It's means it's without "bells and whisles"
19:30 < waldi> hmm, not in my copy
19:31 < andred> nanoprobe: Didn't you mean fatfree?
19:31 < nanoprobe> andred: Ahh, yeah.
19:32 < andred> nanoprobe: You shouldn't translate word by word. Try to stay close to the original, but don't write write swedish with english word flow because of that.
19:32 < nanoprobe> ok
19:33 < nanoprobe> But I'll start translate autopartkit, there was no swedish trans. for that as far as I can see.

19:34 < andred> I haven't started on that one. But just because there aren't any swedish translations of the stuff in CVS doesn't mean they don't exist. I've done lots of them that haven't been checked in yet, so ask me before you begin with something.
19:34 < andred> oh, wait. I have done that one
19:35 < nanoprobe> Darn ;)
19:35 < andred> Ohh, you meant that FatFree. That meant how much space was free in FAT.

19:36 < nanoprobe> andred: Aboot-installer then?
19:37 < andred> nanoprobe: Yeah, I've done all those things in the beginning
19:37 < andred> Check out mips/
19:37 < nanoprobe> ok
19:38 < andred> s390 is another one I haven't done
19:40 < andred> The boring stuff;-)
19:41 < andred> Well, a lot of what I've done is horribly boring too
19:45 < waldi> andred: s390 currently don't support translated things, as the terminal is ebdic and supports only a small subset of the ascii charset
19:45 < andred> hehe, okay. That leavs mips:-)
19:49 < manty> Marvin--: the images you have at your home at people.d.o are supposed to be ok?
19:49 < manty> I mean at people.debian.org/~sjogren
19:49 < manty> :-?
19:51 < nanoprobe> andred: What's your translation for bootloader?
19:51 -!- noshadow [~brl@pcpool09.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de] has quit ["and away..."]
19:52 < andred> nanoprobe: startladdare
19:53 < andred> nanoprobe: I'm going to talk to Peter Karlsson if we should include "boot loader" in paranthesis after it, since that's a well known notion

19:55 < nanoprobe> Ok, thanks.

20:06 < vinsci> are new builds possible again, now? (looking forward to solve the thinkpad R40e problem)
20:06 < Marvin--> andred, nanoprobe: do you guys know (of) Daniel Husand?
20:06 < andred> Marvin--: I don't
20:06 < Marvin--> he, too, has offered to help with translation
20:06 < Marvin--> sheesh :)
20:07 < andred> Oh boy
20:07 < andred> I wish people would have come sooner, or that I would have taken it more slowly. I'm almost done, I think.

20:35 -!- Netsplit sterling.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: Balu, waldi
20:35 < andred> Hmm, either I can review it and pass it on to someone with CVS access, or you can send it directly to Marvin-- or Peter Karlsson for review. I suggest the latter, because Peter is really good att suggesting improvements, and he can then check it into CVS.
20:36 -!- Netsplit over, joins: Balu
20:37 < nanoprobe> Ok, who is Peter and how do I send him the file?

21:42 < andred> Marvin--: By the way, when do you think you'll get a chance to check in my translations?
21:45 < vinsci> how would you expect d-i to react on a system without a serial port?
21:46 < vinsci> is there a way to disable serial port usage in beta1?
21:47 < andred> I donno, few people use serial ports these days, but most still have them activated.
21:47 < vinsci> d-i freezes on a ThinkPad R40e , which doesn't have a serial port (nor a floppy)
21:48 < andred> That's not how I would want it to react;-)
21:49 < vinsci> me neither ;)
21:53 < Marvin--> andred: I'm kinda trying to work on my degree project, got an idea earlier today that I want to investigate
21:54 < Marvin--> andred: but I guess I could take a break

21:58 < vinsci> can I simply remaster the beta1 iso with a more suitable kernel?
22:00 < stratus> Is cvs access still blocked? Why?
22:00 < waldi> ask elmo
22:02 < stratus> omg :( just as a footnote the cvs tree is browsable through viewcvs (http://cvs.d.o)
22:02 < frankie> stratus: yep pserver is down
22:02 < stratus> frankie, thanks.
22:03 < stratus> only elmo knows when it will be back?
22:03  * frankie remembers some pserver security issue read around
22:04 < frankie> stratus: i currently can access only repositories by :ext: method and passwd, no anon access
22:04 < stratus> I need rebuild d-i with another kernel.Can i download the beta-1 sources from a trustable place?
22:05 < stratus> frankie, i don't have accounts.

22:15  * vinsci tries anaconda instead
22:20 < andred> Marvin--: The order shouldn't matter I guess
22:21 < andred> Well, some have been corrected and then I've sent a later mail
22:23 < andred> choose-mirror, cdrom-detect, ddetect, partconf and partitioner have been sent more than once, so pick the latest e-mail of those. Usually I've written something like "uppdaterad" or "korrigerad" in that subject line
22:25 < andred> The tree translations in "Korrigerade Ã¶versÃ¤ttningar" should be ready for checkin, because Peter has checked those througly
22:25 < andred> s/tree/three
22:27 < Marvin--> right
22:31 < andred> So, stuff like usb-discover which doesn't have any templates, are they just not ready for that yet, or will they not have any translatable strings?
22:37 < Marvin--> if a package doesn't have any templates it's a good bet it isn't interactive ;)
22:38 < andred> Sounds logical:-)
22:38 < Marvin--> grmf, my neighbour has finished his degree project
22:38 < Marvin--> must...keep...working...
22:47 < andred> Some directories have po/ files under them, but no tranaslation. Those were the ones I were confused about.
22:48 < Marvin--> they may have had templates before and then stuff has been rearranged
22:48 < Marvin--> you know how cvs is when it comes to directories
22:53 < vinsci> any source snapshots available for us non-developers?
22:54 -!- bdale [~bdale@rover.gag.com] has quit [Remote closed the connection]
23:00 < andred> Marvin--: Thanks for checking those three files in. Should I send the rest of the stuff that I've already sent to you to Peter so that he can review them and check them in?
23:04  * joeyh sighs, and decides not to change base-config's templates
23:04 < Marvin--> let's see, I've checked in anna, main-menu, choose-mirror, partitioner, partconf, utils, base-installer, prebaseconfig, ddetect, cdrom-detect
23:04 < joeyh> I was too lazy to commit it last night..
23:05 < andred> Marvin--: Oh, great. I didn't see all those
23:05 < Marvin--> andred: the mails are on the way I guess
23:09 < waldi> joeyh: do we realy need a slave cvs with anonymous access?
23:10 < joeyh> I wish I knew what the status was
23:10 < waldi> the behaviour of d-admin looks like
23:11 < joeyh> for now I'm assuming they have a good reason
23:12 < waldi> thats why *bsd uses anoncvs via ssh
23:12 < joeyh> yes, I used to do that too (when I had a cvs repo)
23:13 < vinsci> a daily tarball should be enough for us without debian accounts...
23:14 < vinsci> and if I could find one, I could fix the problem for the ThinkPads...
23:15 < joeyh> someone could just turn on the download tarball option in cvsweb
23:17 < vinsci> better hurry up before the anaconda download finished ;-)

23:29 < stratus> :(
23:29 < stratus> Can i download the beta1 sources from any trusted place?
23:31 < joeyh> beta1 sources?
23:31 < joeyh> what good would that be, they're 1.5 months old
23:32 < vinsci> current source preferred, I think
23:32 < joeyh> the entirity of d-i source is in the archive in source packages of course
23:32 < seppy> I just found a typo in the installer. Is it ok to fix it in cvs's templates.pot?
23:34 < vinsci> hmm, d-i is all of 29 kB?
23:35 < stratus> i prefer the current source, of course.
23:36 < stratus> but all we know that pserver is down :)
23:36 < Marvin--> so go get it from the web interface, you lazy bum! :)
23:37 < stratus> haha, how? :)
23:37 < stratus> <joeyh> someone could just turn on the download tarball option in cvsweb
23:37 < Marvin--> we-ell, you can click around and save as on everything you want ;)
23:38 < Marvin--> but cvsweb tarball sounds better ;)
23:39 < stratus> You can put the tarball on people.d.o for ppl without account and send a message to debian-devel signed.

23:39 < vinsci> apt-get source debian-installer works too, apparently... could be interesting doing an apt-get build-dep on that
23:40 < stratus> vinsci, from main/debian-installer repo?
23:41 < vinsci> unstable/main
23:41 < vinsci> I suppose with packages.d.o down, there's no experimental uploads
23:42 < stratus> Is d-i really there?
23:42 < vinsci> $ apt-get source debian-installer
23:43 < stratus> 20031113
23:43 < stratus> ;(
23:43 < vinsci> yes...
23:44 < stratus> btw, it's better than download each file from cvs web interface.
23:44 < vinsci> that's not an option :)
23:44 < stratus> vinsci, only for Marvin-- :)
23:46 < vinsci> well, my itch is going away at a 1Mbps rate right now...

23:49 < stratus> vinsci, what?
23:49 < vinsci> so let me rephrase that

00:23 < otavio> some idea?
00:25 < jbailey> It looks like that new rootskel was all ia64 needed to build from that last CVS snapshot that I got.  Hopefully my part of the upload will go tonight.
00:26 < otavio> jbailey: I'm using i386. Some general change?
00:27 < jbailey> No - just that I hadn't bothered setting to machine up to upload to gluck again since the compromise, and the ia64 buildd doesn't seem to be back online.
00:27 < jbailey> I built the missing piece myself and uploaded it, so with any luck it'll upload tonight so that manty can make the cd image.

20:04 -!- p2-mate [~p2@NAT.office.mind.be] has joined #debian-boot
20:04 < gaudenz> joeyh: I created gaudenz-guest at alioth how can I get added to d-i?
20:04 < pere> gaudenz: I give up on Eric Gillespie as we are obviosuly not able to communicate, and hope someone else might have more success.
20:05 < joeyh> gaudenz: added
20:05 < gaudenz> pere: branden/overfiend understood you :-)
20:06 < gaudenz> joeyh: Do I have to get a fresh checkout from alioth or is it possible to use the old cvs checkout? Or did we move to svn?
20:06 < joeyh> it's still in cvs
20:06 < waldi> gaudenz: cvstools
20:06 < waldi> cvschroot
20:06 < pere> gaudenz: can you take over the communication?  I am just getting frustrated.
20:06 < joeyh> I posted to debian-boot with a command that can move repositories
20:06 < joeyh> have to substitute in your info of course
20:06 < gaudenz> pere: I will try...
20:07 < joeyh> cvschroot, kewl
20:07 < gaudenz> pere: What about just checking in the didiscover we have into ddetect and using that?
20:07 < gaudenz> kewl?
20:08 < pere> gaudenz: that might work, but is it "upgrade-friendly"?
20:08 < giuseppe> joeyh: I did try the new CVS and I get an error: cvs server: failed to create lock directory for `/cvsroot/d-i/debian-installer' (/cvsroot/d-i/debian-installer/#cvs.lock): Permission denied
20:08 < joeyh> hm
20:08 < gaudenz> pere: As long as the libdiscover APi does not change it should work.
20:08 < pere> giuseppe: sounds like the directory is missing group write access.
20:09 < giuseppe> right, the CVS directory
20:09 < giuseppe> pere: do you have the same problem?
20:09 < joeyh> do they all need it, or only toplevel?
20:09 < pere> joeyh: I can co-maintain alioth if you want.
20:09 < waldi> joeyh: find /cvsroot/d-i/ -type d | xargs chmod 2775
20:09 < giuseppe> joeyh: now the problem is in anna
20:10 < giuseppe> joeyh: ok, it is working now
20:10  * joeyh goes to fix base-config too
20:10 < joeyh> ok
20:11 < pere> giuseppe: I haven't had time to get back to d-i development yet, so I haven't tested it. :)
20:11 < waldi> fuck, my ibook misses a cursor on the fb

21:15 < jackhead> I am still struggeling with broken dependencies for hwdetect:
21:15 < jackhead> hw-detect: Depends: rootskel (>= 0.54) but it is not going to be installed
21:16 < jackhead> I have tried building a local udeb repository, but dpkg-scanpackages seems to be broken with regard to udebs
21:16 < joeyh> is this during build?
21:16 < jackhead> The -u option does not work
21:16 < jackhead> joeyh: yes
21:16 < joeyh> doesn't your arch have that rootskel yet?
21:16 < joeyh> It was released on 3 dec
21:16 < jackhead> joeyh: only and old version
21:17 < joeyh> well, build the new one and drop it in localudebs?
21:17 < jackhead> mipsel is still at 0.53
21:17 < jackhead> I did that
21:17 < jackhead> But that does not solve the dependency
21:17 < jackhead> It should, but it does not.
21:17 < joeyh> oh, yes, of course
21:17 -!- godog [~filo@212.141.115.184] has quit ["Each new user of a new system uncovers a new class of bugs."]

21:23 < otavio> joeyh: probably ... ok. I'll wait
21:23 < joeyh> Anthro: it should support any pcmcia card that linux supports
21:24 < Anthro> joeyh: Will it detect it, or do I have to load a module (or more than one?) when given the opportunity? Which one(s)?
21:24 < joeyh> it should just detect it
21:25 < otavio> joeyh: the description of keybord name come from console-keymaps-* no?

22:01 < teo> wop
22:03  * teo doing backup before running that weird perl command :)
22:04 < joeyh> apparently there is a cvschroot command that might be safer.

22:09 < teo> may be the adding to the group is delayed?
22:09 < joeyh> it may take up to an hour for the change to take
22:09 < joeyh> some cron job I think
22:10 < teo> it's ok, thank you
22:10 < waldi> alioth uses the sf software which uses cronjobs for anything
22:10 < manty> re
22:10 < joeyh> ah, manty
22:10 < teo> hi manty
22:10 < manty> hi
22:11  * manty is short on batery, so expecting interruption in 19 minutes or so
22:11 < teo> waldi, I hope that they are distributed in time, if all of them run at the same time every $TIMEPERIOD
22:12 < joeyh> manty: the isos lack kernel-pcmcia-modules packages to go with the kernel packages. This means pcmcia can't work after install
22:12 < joeyh> any chance that can easily be fixed?
22:12 < teo> joeyh, let me know if you need help managing the alioth project
22:12 < manty> joeyh: I think so
22:12 < manty> that is not an udeb, right?
22:13 < joeyh> I think these packages are i386 specific, yes they are debs
22:13 < joeyh> next on my list is getting some non-isoliniux isos produced
22:13 < joeyh> maybe this is not a good time for that with the build system still fubar
22:14 < manty> joeyh: let's see...
22:15 < joeyh> then we need to look at copying the syslinux .txt files from d-i to the isolinux isos, so their help texts actually match d-i
22:15 < manty> I'll try to check the kernel-pcmcia-modules thing
22:15 < manty> but about the isolinux...
22:15 < joeyh> after that, there is the issue of slimming down the isos so they still fit on eg, 128 (-5 for boot) mb usb sticks
22:15 < manty> the problem we had had nothing to do with isolinux
22:15 < manty> that is a bug on certain bios
22:16 < joeyh> yeah, I know, that's why we need some syslinux isos
22:16 < manty> the same isolinux but the bussinesscard instead of the netinst
22:16 < manty> worked
22:16 < joeyh> oh, really?
22:16 < manty> on those machines
22:16 < manty> yes
22:16 < joeyh> all of them?
22:16 < manty> it must be some obscure bug
22:16 < joeyh> we got lots of failure reports
22:16 < manty> I don't know
22:16 < manty> I can produce images
22:16 < manty> and verify them here
22:16 < joeyh> seems to me if we can just make some syslinux images to point people at when this fails, that would be good
22:16 < manty> with a machine on which isolinux breaks
22:17 < joeyh> I have no problem with keeping isolinu default, it's entirely up to debian-cd
22:17 < manty> I still think that syslinux is more compatible
22:17 < manty> and will work on most systems
22:17 < joeyh> yes, me too
22:17 < manty> but I'd like to debug the isolinux problem
22:18 < manty> the thing is that I wrote both the authors of mkisofs and isolinux
22:18 < manty> and got an aswer back from the isolinux guy saying that I was not giving enough info
22:18 < manty> so I wrote back with more info
22:18 < manty> and no reply since then
22:19 < manty> we can start making no isolinux images
22:19 < manty> but that won't fix the problem
22:19 < joeyh> that would be good
22:19 < jackhead> joeyh: some preliminary status feedback: mipsel builds successfully builds a bootable netboot image now.
22:19 < joeyh> jackhead: cool!
22:19 < manty> I don't know if the syslinux image is already fixed
22:20 < manty> it had no info at all in syslinux
22:20 < manty> I had reported that when I tested on building cds with syslinux
22:20 < gaudenz> joeyh: Is the terminal of the floppy installs without utf8?
22:20 < jackhead> joeyh: there are still bugs in it, but at least it autobuilds now and it actually boots.
22:20 < joeyh> gaudenz: it should have the full framebuffer and utf-8
22:20 < manty> joeyh: anyway, I'll check that also
22:20 < joeyh> manty: do you mean it lacked the syslinux screens?
22:21 < gaudenz> languagechooser shows strange characters..
22:21 < manty> yes
22:21 < manty> joeyh: it had one and was almost empty
22:22 < joeyh> if you look in a current cdrom-image.img from d-i, it will have full syslinux helps texts in it, customised for d-i
22:22 < joeyh> that may eventually include a boot logo too
22:22 < joeyh> maybe it's stupid to include that in that file, if it needs to really be elsewhere on the cd
22:22 < joeyh> does it need to be elsewhere for syslinux, or is that right?
22:23 < jackhead> joeyh: One bug in the "detect network hardware stage". The system treis to load the usual modules (ide, ide-cd and so on) and sees that they do not exist (drivers are compiled in). That is fine so far, but then I get a red screen stating "Error while running 'modprobe -v sd_mod'". This module does not exist either, because CDROM support is compiled in.
22:23 < joeyh> gaudenz: that would tend to indicate framebuffer is working, unless they're strange latin characters.. ;-)
22:24 < gaudenz> joeyh: They look like utf8 printed in latin1
22:24 < joeyh> jackhead: I think you may have an old hw-detect
22:24 < jackhead> joeyh: I'll rebuild it from source and give it another try
22:25 < joeyh> it's also possible that discover is reporting that sd_mod is needed (it does not on i386, and so there is a special hack to modprobe it, but this should not display anything if it fails
22:27 < joeyh> gaudenz: it looks correct in my local build in vmware
22:28 -!- pere is now known as pere_poff
22:28 < joeyh> gaudenz: hmm, make sure you have a /unifont.bgf
22:29 < gaudenz> joeyh: unifont.bgf is only 56379 bytes is that possible?
22:29 < joeyh> should be 2.4 mb
22:29 < gaudenz> joeyh: How can I detect if i'm running on framebuffer?
22:30 < joeyh> dunno, I can tell in vmware because of the screen size and font

23:21 < jackhead> Is this intentional?

23:18 < manty> well, anyway
23:18 < manty> I have it setup at my home
23:18 < manty> with everything audited
23:18 < buxy> when did you mail -admin ?
23:18 < manty> and all that
23:18 < manty> on the 8th
23:18 < manty> I believe
23:19 < manty> do you want a copy of the mails?
23:19 < buxy> yes please
23:19 < manty> I have emailed them again afterwards
23:19 < buxy> i was going to ask you
23:19 < manty> ok
23:19 < manty> a minute
23:19 < buxy> I want to ping them, I'm fed up with all the mails about the 404 ... :)
23:21 < buxy> I suggest that you clean the tree in oldgluck like I mentionned (by replacing everything with the copy you have in your home tree for example)
23:21 < buxy> that way, they just have to move the full dir and they're done

23:34 < manty> what address do you want me to send the mails?
23:35 < manty> I'm bouncing them to your debian.org address
23:36 < manty> btw
23:37 < manty> I have checked the debian-cd cvs already
23:37 < manty> there is nothing wrong with it
23:37 < manty> at least on the final checkout
23:37 < manty> it is exactly what I have at home
23:37 < manty> I think I was the last one commiting
23:38 < manty> so...
23:38 < manty> what do I do...
23:38 < joeyh> are you going to be able to restore the beta1 images?
23:38 < manty> I don't think so
23:38 < manty> I don't have copies or MD5sums
23:38 < joeyh> IIRC the urls in the topic have some known good ones
23:38 < manty> if we could gather the md5sums...
23:39 < manty> then we could
23:39 < joeyh> they include gpg signed md5sums, I think.
23:39 < manty> which one?
23:40 < joeyh> hm, no, they are 11/19, after the beta
23:40 < joeyh> never mind
23:40 < joeyh> gotta go, setting up a dir that can just be copied in sounds good
23:41 < manty> ok
23:41 < manty> buxy: tell me when you have read what I sent you
23:41 < manty> buxy: if you have received it

00:17 < manty> buxy: I was thinking that gluck.debian.org/cdimage is not a goot name
00:18 < manty> maybe testingimages.debian.org or testingisos.debian.org would be better, don't you think?
00:18 < manty> we can keep the old name also
00:18 < manty> if I remember well when we started this it was supposed to be cdimage.debian.org
00:19 < manty> but then there was some problem with that
00:19 < manty> what about a new name without problems?
00:41 < buxy> it's not a priority really
00:42 < buxy> I'd better have it online right now
00:42 < manty> sure
00:42 < manty> but as the old dir was called cdimage.debian.org
00:42 < manty> and that was not the name of the web...
00:43 < manty> also, the old config for apache stated that we were cdimage.debian.org, which we weren't
00:43 < buxy> manty: yeah, please setup everything in /home/oldgluck/org/cdimage.debian.org (and remove all the cruft there)
00:43 < manty> ok, ok I'll do it
00:43 < buxy> we still do not have any vhost for that service, it's not a problem
00:44 < manty> but tomorrow
00:44 < manty> today I have to go to sleep
00:44 < buxy> it's better to have that called gluck.debian.org/cdimage because it shows that it's not something too official

19:09 < Sesse> if cvs.alioth.debian.org had multiple A records, I could probably understand this
19:09 < Sesse> but there is only one :-)
19:09 < kungfuftr> *cough* don't suppose anyone would happen to know what dpkg actually requires in a target directory to run (ie: --root=)
19:09 < kungfuftr> ?
19:09 < Sesse> kungfuftr: a debian installation?
19:09 < kungfuftr> Sesse-> what if there isn't one?
19:09 < Sesse> probably /var/lib/dpkg with some sane info.
19:10 < teo> joeyh, could I'd be added to the base-config project? I'm making an effort for that spanish translation too

19:10 < kungfuftr> Sesse-> heh, how can one define "sane"... =0)
19:11 < nevyn> I recently ran debian installer on a bunch of systems and had major kernel issues (using the image that is mentioned in the topic) does this reflect other peoples experience of the beta?
19:11 < kungfuftr> Sesse-> is there a sane place one could find such sane info?
19:11 < Sesse> kungfuftr: what are you trying to do? :-)
19:12 < kungfuftr> use dpkg itself to do a bootstrap installation into a target directory.
19:12 < nevyn> I got kernel panics on partitioning disks. for one system and when running discover after completing install for another.
19:12 < Sesse> use debootstrap?
19:12 < Sesse> nevyn: hmm, haven't heard of before
19:12 < kungfuftr> um... that's what i'm currently re-writing, so it would kind fo defeat the purpose
19:12 < nevyn> system installs woody fine.
19:13 < Sesse> kungfuftr: yet another debootstrap rewrite? :-)
19:13 < nevyn> pentium 133 and pentium 233mmx
19:13 < Sesse> nevyn: file an installation report.
19:13 < nevyn> both 64meg of ram...
19:13 < Sesse> have you tried the latest daily images?
19:13 < nevyn> are they what's linked in the topic?
19:13 < joeyh> teo: sure, done. I should really add all d-i translators, but it's a lot of mindless work
19:13 < kungfuftr> Sesse-> it's an internal project here at the office as it needs to tie in with our systems
19:14 < teo> joeyh, yes, it can be done when they ask
19:15 < kungfuftr> is already rather quite nice... just stumped on how to 'elude' dpkg to actually install stuff into the target directory... after that. i'm sorted.

19:21 < nevyn> is the whole 64meg requirement going away anytime soon?
19:22 < joeyh> in my testing, it's closer to 32 mb
19:22 < joeyh> but you should enable swa as soon as you can
19:22 < joeyh> if you boot with framebuffer disabled, that will save some 2 or 3 mb
19:22 < nevyn> yeah but the problem is the installer unpacks a whole bunch of udebs. that it won't need util way after swap is enabled.
19:23 < joeyh> Md: btw, your patch assumed a lot of stuff busybox doesn't do, but I think I've fixed it all
19:23 < joeyh> yes, however those will fit in ~33 mb
19:23 < Md> joeyh: what kind of stuff?
19:23 < nevyn> joeyh: that's far too big.
19:23 < joeyh> sed options, gre doesn't do regexs
19:24 < joeyh> er, grep
19:24 < waldi> *rebuild busybox*
19:24 < nevyn> is there any plan to make the installer only install the udebs that are essential to get swap/disk partitioning going then pivotroot/use swap for the other udebs?
19:24 < joeyh> the debix thing has the potential to drop it to 16 mb for cd installs
19:24 < Md> sorry, I did not remember that these script are run with the busybox tools
19:24 < joeyh> I doubt you'd save more than 5 mb doing that
19:25 < joeyh> a special udeb that searched out free space and used it as swap could maybe save a bit more
19:28 < joeyh> there are some other easy changes that I estimate can push it down to 24 mb.
19:28 < joeyh> of course we could also try compressing the ramdisk
19:29 < nevyn> joeyh: that's still larger than any other distro...
19:29 < nevyn> we should be able to compete with slackware on this.
19:29 < joeyh> surely you'd kidding
19:31 < Md> I'd love to be able to install debian on a 16 MB box, but it's probably easier to attach the hard disk somewhere else...
19:31 < joeyh> it's certianly easier when you get to dselect
19:31 < Md> or just use a distribution made for this kind of old stuff
19:31 < waldi> is anyone able to do some tests with busybox?
19:31 < waldi> otherwise i will just upload them
19:32 < nevyn> no I'm really not kidding.
19:33 < nevyn> we should be able to install debian on 8meg machines. it won't be fast.... but it should work.
19:33 < joeyh> oh well, I suppose if someone actually cares about it, they will do the work
19:33 < joeyh> hah
19:33 < joeyh> I still think you're wrong, I'd not be suprised if commercial distos has 64 to 128 minimum ram requirements these days
19:34 < nevyn> slackware still installs on 4meg I think.
19:34 < waldi> nevyn: no
19:34 < waldi> nevyn: at least not with kernel > 2.0
19:34 < waldi> on i386
19:34 < Md> I would definitely not install a general purpose distribution on a 4 MB box
19:35  * joeyh finds a post about redhat 7.1 saying 32 mb
19:36 < nevyn> waldi: what's the minimum for slackware then?
19:36 < waldi> nevyn: don't know
19:36 < waldi> nevyn: but the kernel needs at least 5mb
19:36 < waldi> so the distribution can't need less
19:37 < nevyn> what kernel the default slackware one ?
19:37 < waldi> i never used slackware
19:37 < nevyn> the kernel does not require 5meg of ram.
19:37 < joeyh> the new -small kernel looks interesting
19:38 < joeyh> or -tiny I forget
19:38 < nevyn> it's a bloated piece of crap but it doesn't need 5meg.
