18:58 < waldi> parted may be better but lacks support for ibm disklabels

19:05 < dan_t> waldi: how i can search for partitions then ?
19:27 < andred> nanoprobe: Let me know when you're going to start translating. I've done a few more translations and I'm working on some others now, so I want to make sure you don't start on anything I've already done.
19:27 < nanoprobe> andred: Ok, was just about to start. Must every word be translated? Even such untransable words as 'freefat'
19:28 < waldi> freefat?
19:30 < andred> fatfree?
19:30 < nanoprobe> in tools/autopartkit/debian/po/
19:30 < nanoprobe> Haven't a clue what it is.
19:30 < andred> It's means it's without "bells and whisles"
19:30 < waldi> hmm, not in my copy
19:31 < andred> nanoprobe: Didn't you mean fatfree?
19:31 < nanoprobe> andred: Ahh, yeah.
19:32 < andred> nanoprobe: You shouldn't translate word by word. Try to stay close to the original, but don't write write swedish with english word flow because of that.
19:32 < nanoprobe> ok
19:33 < nanoprobe> But I'll start translate autopartkit, there was no swedish trans. for that as far as I can see.

19:34 < andred> I haven't started on that one. But just because there aren't any swedish translations of the stuff in CVS doesn't mean they don't exist. I've done lots of them that haven't been checked in yet, so ask me before you begin with something.
19:34 < andred> oh, wait. I have done that one
19:35 < nanoprobe> Darn ;)
19:35 < andred> Ohh, you meant that FatFree. That meant how much space was free in FAT.

19:36 < nanoprobe> andred: Aboot-installer then?
19:37 < andred> nanoprobe: Yeah, I've done all those things in the beginning
19:37 < andred> Check out mips/
19:37 < nanoprobe> ok
19:38 < andred> s390 is another one I haven't done
19:40 < andred> The boring stuff;-)
19:41 < andred> Well, a lot of what I've done is horribly boring too
19:45 < waldi> andred: s390 currently don't support translated things, as the terminal is ebdic and supports only a small subset of the ascii charset
19:45 < andred> hehe, okay. That leavs mips:-)
19:49 < manty> Marvin--: the images you have at your home at people.d.o are supposed to be ok?
19:49 < manty> I mean at people.debian.org/~sjogren
19:49 < manty> :-?
19:51 < nanoprobe> andred: What's your translation for bootloader?
19:51 -!- noshadow [~brl@pcpool09.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de] has quit ["and away..."]
19:52 < andred> nanoprobe: startladdare
19:53 < andred> nanoprobe: I'm going to talk to Peter Karlsson if we should include "boot loader" in paranthesis after it, since that's a well known notion

19:55 < nanoprobe> Ok, thanks.

20:06 < vinsci> are new builds possible again, now? (looking forward to solve the thinkpad R40e problem)
20:06 < Marvin--> andred, nanoprobe: do you guys know (of) Daniel Husand?
20:06 < andred> Marvin--: I don't
20:06 < Marvin--> he, too, has offered to help with translation
20:06 < Marvin--> sheesh :)
20:07 < andred> Oh boy
20:07 < andred> I wish people would have come sooner, or that I would have taken it more slowly. I'm almost done, I think.

20:35 -!- Netsplit sterling.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: Balu, waldi
20:35 < andred> Hmm, either I can review it and pass it on to someone with CVS access, or you can send it directly to Marvin-- or Peter Karlsson for review. I suggest the latter, because Peter is really good att suggesting improvements, and he can then check it into CVS.
20:36 -!- Netsplit over, joins: Balu
20:37 < nanoprobe> Ok, who is Peter and how do I send him the file?

21:42 < andred> Marvin--: By the way, when do you think you'll get a chance to check in my translations?
21:45 < vinsci> how would you expect d-i to react on a system without a serial port?
21:46 < vinsci> is there a way to disable serial port usage in beta1?
21:47 < andred> I donno, few people use serial ports these days, but most still have them activated.
21:47 < vinsci> d-i freezes on a ThinkPad R40e , which doesn't have a serial port (nor a floppy)
21:48 < andred> That's not how I would want it to react;-)
21:49 < vinsci> me neither ;)
21:53 < Marvin--> andred: I'm kinda trying to work on my degree project, got an idea earlier today that I want to investigate
21:54 < Marvin--> andred: but I guess I could take a break

21:58 < vinsci> can I simply remaster the beta1 iso with a more suitable kernel?
22:00 < stratus> Is cvs access still blocked? Why?
22:00 < waldi> ask elmo
22:02 < stratus> omg :( just as a footnote the cvs tree is browsable through viewcvs (http://cvs.d.o)
22:02 < frankie> stratus: yep pserver is down
22:02 < stratus> frankie, thanks.
22:03 < stratus> only elmo knows when it will be back?
22:03  * frankie remembers some pserver security issue read around
22:04 < frankie> stratus: i currently can access only repositories by :ext: method and passwd, no anon access
22:04 < stratus> I need rebuild d-i with another kernel.Can i download the beta-1 sources from a trustable place?
22:05 < stratus> frankie, i don't have accounts.

22:15  * vinsci tries anaconda instead
22:20 < andred> Marvin--: The order shouldn't matter I guess
22:21 < andred> Well, some have been corrected and then I've sent a later mail
22:23 < andred> choose-mirror, cdrom-detect, ddetect, partconf and partitioner have been sent more than once, so pick the latest e-mail of those. Usually I've written something like "uppdaterad" or "korrigerad" in that subject line
22:25 < andred> The tree translations in "Korrigerade Ã¶versÃ¤ttningar" should be ready for checkin, because Peter has checked those througly
22:25 < andred> s/tree/three
22:27 < Marvin--> right
22:31 < andred> So, stuff like usb-discover which doesn't have any templates, are they just not ready for that yet, or will they not have any translatable strings?
22:37 < Marvin--> if a package doesn't have any templates it's a good bet it isn't interactive ;)
22:38 < andred> Sounds logical:-)
22:38 < Marvin--> grmf, my neighbour has finished his degree project
22:38 < Marvin--> must...keep...working...
22:47 < andred> Some directories have po/ files under them, but no tranaslation. Those were the ones I were confused about.
22:48 < Marvin--> they may have had templates before and then stuff has been rearranged
22:48 < Marvin--> you know how cvs is when it comes to directories
22:53 < vinsci> any source snapshots available for us non-developers?
22:54 -!- bdale [~bdale@rover.gag.com] has quit [Remote closed the connection]
23:00 < andred> Marvin--: Thanks for checking those three files in. Should I send the rest of the stuff that I've already sent to you to Peter so that he can review them and check them in?
23:04  * joeyh sighs, and decides not to change base-config's templates
23:04 < Marvin--> let's see, I've checked in anna, main-menu, choose-mirror, partitioner, partconf, utils, base-installer, prebaseconfig, ddetect, cdrom-detect
23:04 < joeyh> I was too lazy to commit it last night..
23:05 < andred> Marvin--: Oh, great. I didn't see all those
23:05 < Marvin--> andred: the mails are on the way I guess
23:09 < waldi> joeyh: do we realy need a slave cvs with anonymous access?
23:10 < joeyh> I wish I knew what the status was
23:10 < waldi> the behaviour of d-admin looks like
23:11 < joeyh> for now I'm assuming they have a good reason
23:12 < waldi> thats why *bsd uses anoncvs via ssh
23:12 < joeyh> yes, I used to do that too (when I had a cvs repo)
23:13 < vinsci> a daily tarball should be enough for us without debian accounts...
23:14 < vinsci> and if I could find one, I could fix the problem for the ThinkPads...
23:15 < joeyh> someone could just turn on the download tarball option in cvsweb
23:17 < vinsci> better hurry up before the anaconda download finished ;-)

23:29 < stratus> :(
23:29 < stratus> Can i download the beta1 sources from any trusted place?
23:31 < joeyh> beta1 sources?
23:31 < joeyh> what good would that be, they're 1.5 months old
23:32 < vinsci> current source preferred, I think
23:32 < joeyh> the entirity of d-i source is in the archive in source packages of course
23:32 < seppy> I just found a typo in the installer. Is it ok to fix it in cvs's templates.pot?
23:34 < vinsci> hmm, d-i is all of 29 kB?
23:35 < stratus> i prefer the current source, of course.
23:36 < stratus> but all we know that pserver is down :)
23:36 < Marvin--> so go get it from the web interface, you lazy bum! :)
23:37 < stratus> haha, how? :)
23:37 < stratus> <joeyh> someone could just turn on the download tarball option in cvsweb
23:37 < Marvin--> we-ell, you can click around and save as on everything you want ;)
23:38 < Marvin--> but cvsweb tarball sounds better ;)
23:39 < stratus> You can put the tarball on people.d.o for ppl without account and send a message to debian-devel signed.

23:39 < vinsci> apt-get source debian-installer works too, apparently... could be interesting doing an apt-get build-dep on that
23:40 < stratus> vinsci, from main/debian-installer repo?
23:41 < vinsci> unstable/main
23:41 < vinsci> I suppose with packages.d.o down, there's no experimental uploads
23:42 < stratus> Is d-i really there?
23:42 < vinsci> $ apt-get source debian-installer
23:43 < stratus> 20031113
23:43 < stratus> ;(
23:43 < vinsci> yes...
23:44 < stratus> btw, it's better than download each file from cvs web interface.
23:44 < vinsci> that's not an option :)
23:44 < stratus> vinsci, only for Marvin-- :)
23:46 < vinsci> well, my itch is going away at a 1Mbps rate right now...

23:49 < stratus> vinsci, what?
23:49 < vinsci> so let me rephrase that

00:23 < otavio> some idea?
00:25 < jbailey> It looks like that new rootskel was all ia64 needed to build from that last CVS snapshot that I got.  Hopefully my part of the upload will go tonight.
00:26 < otavio> jbailey: I'm using i386. Some general change?
00:27 < jbailey> No - just that I hadn't bothered setting to machine up to upload to gluck again since the compromise, and the ia64 buildd doesn't seem to be back online.
00:27 < jbailey> I built the missing piece myself and uploaded it, so with any luck it'll upload tonight so that manty can make the cd image.

20:03 < gaudenz> pere: tock tock ...
20:03  * manty leaves, bbl
20:04 < pere> gaudenz: I'm yet again trying to get overfiend over to #debian-boot to discuss discover.
20:04 -!- p2-mate [~p2@NAT.office.mind.be] has joined #debian-boot
20:04 < gaudenz> joeyh: I created gaudenz-guest at alioth how can I get added to d-i?
20:04 < pere> gaudenz: I give up on Eric Gillespie as we are obviosuly not able to communicate, and hope someone else might have more success.
20:05 < joeyh> gaudenz: added
20:05 < gaudenz> pere: branden/overfiend understood you :-)
20:06 < gaudenz> joeyh: Do I have to get a fresh checkout from alioth or is it possible to use the old cvs checkout? Or did we move to svn?
20:06 < joeyh> it's still in cvs
20:06 < waldi> gaudenz: cvstools
20:06 < waldi> cvschroot
20:06 < pere> gaudenz: can you take over the communication?  I am just getting frustrated.
20:06 < joeyh> I posted to debian-boot with a command that can move repositories
20:06 < joeyh> have to substitute in your info of course
20:06 < gaudenz> pere: I will try...
20:07 < joeyh> cvschroot, kewl
20:07 < gaudenz> pere: What about just checking in the didiscover we have into ddetect and using that?
20:07 < gaudenz> kewl?
20:08 < pere> gaudenz: that might work, but is it "upgrade-friendly"?
20:08 < giuseppe> joeyh: I did try the new CVS and I get an error: cvs server: failed to create lock directory for `/cvsroot/d-i/debian-installer' (/cvsroot/d-i/debian-installer/#cvs.lock): Permission denied
20:08 < joeyh> hm
20:08 < gaudenz> pere: As long as the libdiscover APi does not change it should work.
20:08 < pere> giuseppe: sounds like the directory is missing group write access.
20:09 < giuseppe> right, the CVS directory
20:09 < giuseppe> pere: do you have the same problem?
20:09 < joeyh> do they all need it, or only toplevel?
20:09 < pere> joeyh: I can co-maintain alioth if you want.
20:09 < waldi> joeyh: find /cvsroot/d-i/ -type d | xargs chmod 2775
20:09 < giuseppe> joeyh: now the problem is in anna
20:10 < giuseppe> joeyh: ok, it is working now
20:10  * joeyh goes to fix base-config too
20:10 < joeyh> ok
20:11 < pere> giuseppe: I haven't had time to get back to d-i development yet, so I haven't tested it. :)
20:11 < waldi> fuck, my ibook misses a cursor on the fb
20:11 < giuseppe> pere: good, so I will have the time to get the translation in sync :-)
