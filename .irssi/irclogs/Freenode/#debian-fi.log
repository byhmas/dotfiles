20:00 < hendry> i now have the ultimate mail setup at last!
20:00  * hendry has discovered offlineimap
20:03 < liiwi> eh
20:03 < Viiru> What does that do?
20:03 < liiwi> heh
20:04 < liiwi> offlineimap rocks
20:05 < Viiru> How do you integrate it with gnus?
20:09 < hendry> Viiru: i guess you specify a local maildir
20:10 < hendry> liiwi: however when i think about it. it does look a lot like a fetchmail/procmail setup i had sometime ago
20:10 < Viiru> hendry: Gnus works in mysterious ways.. Mainly it likes to store mail in a format of it's own. I tried to make it work in a maildir, but there were problems..
20:11 < hendry> Viiru: it must adhere to RFC standard thingies
20:11 < hendry> surely
20:12 < Viiru> It does.
20:12 < Viiru> But getting mail and storing it are a very diffenrent thing. It gets mail from maildirs with ease, but getting it to store it's mail in one is trciky.
20:13 < hendry> maildir is mail storage format, no?
20:16 < Viiru> Yes. But Gnus doesn't like using it as such.
20:17 < Viiru> It will not store mail in a maildir without great pains. Believe it or try it yourself. ;)
20:17 < hendry> maildir does have it's problems. I don't think it can be put into homedir source control sanely
20:18 < hendry> Viiru: how about vanilla mbox?
20:19 < Viiru> hendry: I don't think it's even possible to make gnus store anything in an mbox. It reads them just fine, though.
20:30 < hendry> i am from the mutt/vim camp
20:31 < liiwi> nnmbox exists, so gnus can use it as backend
20:33 < Viiru> Well, nnmaildir was available as an extra module. Dunno if it's in the source now. Anyway, I never got it to work in anything like a sane manner.
20:37 < hendry> are there any good console RSS readers?
20:37 < Viiru> Hmm. Luulin ensin että moosicin oli NMU:ttanut joku asiallinen henkilö ja yllätyin suuresti havaitessani mitä idioottimaisuuksia ko. henkilö oli tehnyt. Sittenpä tarkistin changelogin ja totesin että eipä ollut järin yllättävää..
20:38 < hendry> i.e. written in python
20:41 < Viiru> Mitenhän se on saanut dh_pythonin hajoamaan?
21:45 < liiwi> hendry: http://toursst.sourceforge.net/
21:46  * Tv pats liiwi
21:47 < Tv> hendry: TouRSSt is python and writes stuff in maildirs.
21:54  * liiwi bites tv's hand
21:56 < Tv> Bad monkey, no cookie!
21:58  * liiwi climbs to a tree and starts munching banana
22:07  * Viiru would like to see liiwi do that.
22:38 < Viiru> Hmph. Sbuild ei näemmä taasen tykkää meikäläisestä.
22:41 < Viiru> Kuivaa käytöstä moinen.
23:10 < hendry> copy and paste is so broken in X
23:11 < Viiru> Hmm?
23:11 < Viiru> Broken? How?
23:12 < hendry> I select a url painstakingly with a mouse in this uxterm
23:12 < hendry> go over to paste it into xterm
23:12 < hendry> go over to paste it into MOZILLA
23:12 < hendry> and some other thing gets pasted in
23:13 < Viiru> Yes, it's a fifo. People get used to it in time.
23:18 < hendry> does Mozilla do XBEL?
23:19 < hendry> toursst does not have a man page. shock.

23:48 < liiwi> hendry: sooo, how many manpages have you written? :P
23:50 < hendry> ok, what about this XBEL stuff
23:50 < hendry> i committed myself to maintaining bookmarks.html in subversion
23:50 < hendry> from mozilla
23:51 < hendry> was this a mistake?
23:58 < hendry> if I want to make a patch for a debian package
23:58 < hendry> how do i do it? i can't recall
23:59 < hendry> cd /tmp/; apt-get source package; cp -r package-1.1/ package-1.1.orig/
--- Day changed Wed Dec 17 2003
00:00 < hendry> and then fix file in package 1.1, and run /tmp$ diff package-1.1/ package-1.1.orig
00:00 < hendry> ?
00:02 < hendry> /tmp$ diff package-1.1/ package-1.1.orig | mail package-maintainer@debian.org
00:14 < liiwi> diff -u
00:15 < liiwi> anyway, goodnight
00:15 < nonix4> -ur
00:16 < nonix4> and usually orig before modified...
00:21 < hendry> nn
00:25 < hendry> shift+insert and middle button paste are outputing different stuff
00:38 < suteri> Puuh. Itkua ja hampaiden kiristystä tämä X :/
