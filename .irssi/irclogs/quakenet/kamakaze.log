21:32 -!- Irssi: Starting query in quakenet with Kamakaze
21:32 <draq> my host
21:32 <draq> i am lagging
21:32 <draq> hmm
21:33 <Kamakaze> is dead
21:33 <Kamakaze> and sagging
21:34 <draq> i am putting a box on the net
21:35 <Kamakaze> is it heavy?
21:35 <draq> sorto
21:35 <Kamakaze> the net cant take much weight
21:35 <Kamakaze> quack quack oops
21:35 <draq> i want to get you guys to help me administrate it :)
21:35 <draq> you sudo privs
21:35 <draq> argh
21:36 <Kamakaze> sure but i might accidentally type rm -R *
21:36 <draq> sonotbtiic
21:36 <draq> :)
21:36 <Kamakaze> that was entirely your fault
21:36 <draq> do you think you have a need for a host/shell thing?
21:36 <Kamakaze> not greatly
21:36 <draq> if you have a million other things to do then, nevermind
21:36 <Kamakaze> dreamhost is what we use
21:37 <Kamakaze> but it depends what you want us to do on it
21:37 <Kamakaze> what does it need other than to be turned on and left?
21:37 <draq> probably updated everyday
21:37 <draq> that is automated
21:37 <draq> but someone should check logs and stuff
21:38 <draq> that will be a mail everyday
21:38 <draq> you see i am putting in the box in hosting
21:38 <Kamakaze> and i can upload terabytes of yu-gi-oh to it when you arent looking
21:38 <draq> then I probably will be away for few months next year
21:38 <draq> i prefer if you didn't download warez on it
21:38 <draq> i want it for dev
21:39 <draq> but if you download a movie every now and then, and i don't notice
21:39 <draq> thats ok
21:39 <Kamakaze> well i download things here now
21:39 <draq> to dreamhost or from home  ?
21:40 <Kamakaze> with my adsl connection
21:40 <Kamakaze> using kazaa and irc and bittorent
21:40 <Kamakaze> i guess a box i can mess more with than dreamhost would be nice
21:40 <draq> so there is no need to download to my box in finland then :P
21:40 <Kamakaze> no that would be silly
21:41 <draq> the box will be interesting from a dev POV
21:41 <draq> it will be running debian unstable
21:41 <draq> so it will be bleeding edge
