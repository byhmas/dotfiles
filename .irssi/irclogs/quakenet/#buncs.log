20:53 <@Mathew> anyone know if striped raid 0 support four drives raided into one, or is it just two banks of two?
20:55 <@Kamakaze> i think i did 3
20:56 <@Mathew> hehe you cant remember allan?
20:56 <@Kamakaze> it was several years ago
20:56 <@Mathew> ah
20:56 <@Kamakaze> i think i did it
20:57 <@Kamakaze> then thought well its not really very useful
20:57 <@Kamakaze> so undid it
20:57 <@Kamakaze> then the hard drives broke
20:57 <@Kamakaze> but thats because they were dodgy ibm ones
20:57 <@Mathew> I wanna get 4 stuck together for real time uncompressed avi output in 60fps
20:57 <@Mathew> So I need around 70mbs a sec
20:58 <@Mathew> hence why I need to find out before I go out and buy four drives
20:58 <@Kamakaze> well i dont see why it wouldnt work
20:58 <@Mathew> me neither, it's a costly experiment though :)
20:58 <@Kamakaze> well you then have 4 hard drives
20:58 <@Kamakaze> its not as if they dont work on their own
20:59 <@Mathew> true but I'm only buying them for that purpose
20:59 <@Kamakaze> well
20:59 <@Kamakaze> i would say yes
20:59  * Mathew slaps ChocoJon
20:59 <@Kamakaze> the minimum is 2 drives
20:59 <@GwieF> the speed of a 4 way raid won't really be better thana 2 way raid
21:00 <@Mathew> not even with bus mastering damian?
21:00 <@Kamakaze> raid 0 says one of its uses it video editing
21:01 <@Kamakaze> and it definitely can be used with 4
21:01 <@Mathew> ah cool n1
21:01 <@Mathew> I think Jon had it set up in his server before it broke :)
21:02 <@Mathew> but I wanted to be sure
21:02 <@GwieF> I can't claim to know all the ins and outs, but the speed increase isnt' very dramatic over a 2 way raid
21:02 <@GwieF> the controller is just as important as the drives as well
21:02 <@Mathew> promise bus mastering on my mobo
21:03 <@Mathew> ATA 133
21:03 <@Mathew> funnily enough it works out cheaper to have 4 than 2 drives, but then there's the noise and reliability issues
21:03 -!- Netsplit over, joins: +aeronic
21:06 <@Kamakaze> yes losing one can be a bitch
21:06 <@Kamakaze> but if you dont intend to keep important data on it
21:06 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: aeronic
21:06 <@Mathew> lots of uncompressed movie renders
21:06 <@Mathew> which will eventually be compressed
21:07 < ChocoJon> Mathew - now paying attention
21:07 < ChocoJon> what's your questions
21:08 <@Mathew> just wondering if raiding 4 drives is beneficial
21:08 <@Mathew> over 2 drives
21:08 <@Mathew> using striped raid 0
21:09 <@Mathew> it'll mainly be used to movie output, so the faster the write speed the better
21:11 <@Kamakaze> well if 4 is cheaper
21:11 <@Kamakaze> than 2 bigger ones
21:11 <@Kamakaze> and 4 will be faster even if not a great deal
21:12 -!- Netsplit over, joins: +aeronic
21:13 < ChocoJon> Mathew: I think that raiding 4 drives using RAID 0, will give 4*capacity (smallest drive) and > 2*drive throughput
21:13 < ChocoJon> but depends on controller
21:14 <@Kamakaze> well obviously he would get all the same make and size drives
21:14 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: aeronic
21:14 <@Mathew> yup
21:14 <@Mathew> 4 * diamondmax 8mb cache
21:14 <@Mathew> bus mastering promise ATA 133 raid controller onboard mobo ChocoJon
21:14 <@Kamakaze> you could get a 2gb hd and stripe it with 3 250gb hard disks for fun
21:15 <@Mathew> hmm  :P
21:19 -!- Netsplit over, joins: +aeronic
21:23 < ChocoJon> Mathew: can't find the exact link but this might help
21:23 < ChocoJon> http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/concepts/perfReadWrite-c.html
21:24 < ChocoJon> there is a limit and I think that 4 drives is the sweet spot for RAID 0
21:24 < ChocoJon> *but* I could be wrong
21:25 < ChocoJon> do you *really* need 70 MB/s?
21:25 <@draq> is RAID the complete answer? what about remote backups?
21:25 <+aeronic> 70mb/s?
21:25 <+aeronic> thats not much
21:25 <@Kamakaze> this isnt for backup
21:25 <+aeronic> :)
21:25 <@Kamakaze> and he doesnt really care about backup
21:26 <@Kamakaze> its for high performance video stuff
21:26 <@draq> so why RAID then?
21:26 <+aeronic> increased performance
21:26 <@Kamakaze> when you are storing uncompressed video 
21:26 <@Kamakaze> and editing it
21:26 <@draq> how about RAM then?
21:26 < ChocoJon> I can get 25 Mb/s on a good day
21:27 <@Kamakaze> lol
21:27 < ChocoJon> on on HD to another
21:27 <+aeronic> you can get 40mb/s on a single drive
21:27 < ChocoJon> (sustained)
21:27 <@Kamakaze> i dont know many machines with 300gb of ram
21:27 < ChocoJon> I would more recommend a low loss compression card
21:27 <@draq> there is a cluster at school with 3.5tb of RAM 
21:27 <@Kamakaze> yes but its not something you have at home now is it
21:27 <@draq> i don't know whether to believe that myself
21:27 <+aeronic> <aeronic> you can get 40mb/s on a single drive <- eg the 250gig 7200rpm ones
21:28 <+aeronic> just go for raid 0, near on 80meg/s
21:28 < ChocoJon> don't you get a problem with transferring that much over the PCI bus?
21:29 <+aeronic> pci goes up to 133meg/s
21:29 < ChocoJon> why did I think that it was 33 Mb/s ?
21:29 < ChocoJon> meh ...
21:29 <+aeronic> 33mh
21:29 <+aeronic> z
21:29 <+aeronic> mhz even
21:30 <+aeronic> 33mhz, and 32bits wide
21:30 <+aeronic> which = 133meg/s
21:30  * ChocoJon facepalms ...
21:33 <@Mathew> basically jon
21:33 <@Mathew> it's for on the fly uncompressed movie output
21:33 <@Mathew> 1 frame = 1.4mbs
21:33 <@Mathew> 30 fps = around 40 mbs needed
21:33 <+aeronic> (in 1280*1024)
21:33 <@Mathew> in 800x600
21:33 < ChocoJon> why use uncompressed is my point?
21:33 <+aeronic> how come
21:33 < ChocoJon> :)
21:33 <@Mathew> gaming outputs
21:33 <+aeronic> 1280*1024 is 1.4meg
21:33 <+aeronic> look at the size of a 1280*1024 bmp :)
21:33 <@Mathew> I'd use uncompressed because it's gonna be repassed at least 3 times
21:34 <+aeronic> or tiff, or tga
21:34 < ChocoJon> repassed?
21:34  * ChocoJon is feeling slow today
21:34 <+aeronic> during the compression i think he means
21:34 <@Mathew> through after effects, lightwave, photoshop, premiere/avid xpress dv
21:34 <@Mathew> different applications
21:34 <@Mathew> want as little degradation as possible
21:34 < ChocoJon> have you considered a DV solution?
21:34 < ChocoJon> 3.6 MB/s
21:34 < ChocoJon> quite a lot less than 40 Mb/s
21:34 < ChocoJon> but not 1280*1024
21:35 <@Mathew> it's fine, I know what I'd like
21:35 < ChocoJon> can't quite remember what res though
21:35 <@Mathew> just getting there that's the problem
21:35 < ChocoJon> DV - is lossless
21:35 < ChocoJon> and I've found it to be very nice
21:35 < ChocoJon> and I know another person who uses it for his job
21:36 <@Mathew> I'm not looking to splash out on equipment
21:37 <@Mathew> plus it's hard to manipulate in DV unless you use DV applications like Avid Xpress
21:39 < ChocoJon> or Premiere
21:40 < ChocoJon> ...
21:42 < ChocoJon> I think that VirtualDub can use DV ...
21:42 <@Mathew> it can pass DV
21:42 <@Mathew> I use lightwave and After effects a lot to do effects
21:43 < ChocoJon> ok - my knowledge is running out here
21:43 < ChocoJon> and don't need to embarass myself more
21:43 <@Mathew> :)
21:43 <@Mathew> dv is nice in a studio
21:43 <@Kamakaze> you should have just answered his question and shut up
21:43 <@Mathew> for pros
21:43 <@Mathew> as they have hardware to create effects
21:44 <@Mathew> for us cheapskates... like me I'll settle for the hard drives :)
21:45 < ChocoJon> I think that RAID 0 w/ 4 drives is going to be best solution
21:45 <@Mathew> well if it doesnt work out I'll have 2 banks of 2 raided drives, so no great loss :)
21:46 <@Mathew> and the same amount of space

21:46 < ChocoJon> it may be better to do a four drive array
21:46 < ChocoJon> *may*
21:46 <@NoVisAnima> lo
21:47 <@Mathew> yep I've clicked on order now, so we'll have to wait and see :)
21:47 < ChocoJon> :)
21:51 <+aeronic> <ChocoJon> I think that RAID 0 w/ 4 drives is going to be best solution
21:51 <+aeronic> fastest, not best :P
21:51 <+aeronic> 4 drives is perfect for raid 5
21:51 <+aeronic> or 01
21:51 < ChocoJon> he wants/needs 70 MB/s
21:52 <+aeronic> but that halves the size
21:52 <+aeronic> what drives has he ordered
21:52 <@Mathew> diamondmax 8mb cache
21:52 <+aeronic> what size
21:52 <@Mathew> 120
21:52 <+aeronic> and model
21:52 <+aeronic> not the plus9?
21:52 <@Mathew> yes
21:52 <+aeronic> oh
21:52 <+aeronic> youll need 4 drives then
21:52 <@Mathew> that's what I ordered
21:52 <+aeronic> kk
21:52 <+aeronic> my plus9 gets around 25meg/s
21:53 <@Mathew> Maxtor DiamondMax Plus9 120GB 8MB Cache - OEM (HD-013-MD)
21:53 <@Mathew> Maxtor's latest DiamondMax Plus 9 series offers the ultimate performance for performance PCs and Digital Video systems. Featuring 7200 rpm operation, fast ATA133 interface and 8MB cache for lightning fast performance this drive uses FDB Fluid Bearings throughout.
21:53 <+aeronic> i prefer the ibms for raw speed
21:53 < ChocoJon> haven't you been paying attention, aeronic ? :-P
21:53 <+aeronic> no
21:53 < ChocoJon> You *might* need a better PSU though
21:53 <+aeronic> =]
21:53 <+aeronic> 400W min
21:54 < ChocoJon> need 650W (I think) for Beast - 9 HDs ...
21:54 <@Mathew> lol
21:54 <@Mathew> yeah I figured that'd be a problem :/
21:54  * aeronic ponders getting 4*250gig drives
21:54 <+aeronic> mmmmmmmmm
21:54 <@Mathew> so I bought a few other things too
21:54 <+aeronic> no neeeed
21:54 <@Mathew> :P
21:54 < ChocoJon> I did *try* to tell him as he was building but he insisted that 350W would be fine ...
21:54  * aeronic orders some dvd-rs
21:55 <+aeronic> technically you only need 10W per drive
21:55 <+aeronic> over what you normally have
21:55 < ChocoJon> yeah - mobo would stay powered for long ...
21:56 <@Mathew> dont think my controller is capable of raid 5 aeronic, it'll have to be striped raid 0
21:56 <+aeronic> k
21:56 <+aeronic> hardware or sw?
21:56 <@Mathew> sw bus mastering on mobo
21:56 < ChocoJon> very few, if any, o/b RAID controllers can do RAID 5 AFAIK
21:56 <+aeronic> indeed
21:56 <+aeronic> think some do 0+1
21:57 <@Mathew> isnt raid 1 the equivalent of mirrored?
21:57 <+aeronic> yup
21:57 <@Mathew> ie backup devices
21:57 <+aeronic> yes, so its no faster than a 2drive raid-0
21:58 <@Mathew> that's only good for corporate businesses though isnt it?
21:58 <@Mathew> if you've got important data
21:58 <+aeronic> well i have important data on my pc
21:58 <+aeronic> i certainly wouldnt have a 4 drive raid-0
21:59 <+aeronic> however, i do back up regularly to cds and things
21:59 <+aeronic> anyone of the 4 drives has a problem, or bad sector = that data gone
21:59 < ChocoJon> I should too

21:59 <+aeronic> fine then
21:59 <+aeronic> id prolly have 4 drives on raid, and one additional

21:20 <@NoVisAnima> dunno the digits
21:20 < Nana> well that's what it says on the site :/
21:20 < |31770|> date("Y-m-d H.m.s", time()) then
21:21 < Nana> you might need to escape the dots/dashes
21:21 < Nana> i forget which are reserved
21:22 < Nana> see if taht works to start off with, if not backslash them
21:22 < Nana> oh no, i think those are ok
21:22 <@NoVisAnima> i thought as much
21:22 < Nana> H is 24 hours by the way
21:22 < Nana> use h if you only want 12 hour clock
21:23 < |31770|> humm still parse erroring tried \ and using ' instead :/
21:24 < Nana> error in what
21:24 <@NoVisAnima> shouldn't be a problem
21:24 < Nana> it'd be more helpful if you could put the whole document online
21:24 < Nana> quite often parse errors arent caused on the line they occur on
21:24 < |31770|> on that line expectin )
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> *mutter* and in c they can even appear in other files *grumble*
21:25 < Nana> expecting )?
21:25 < |31770|> every thing else is working as I was using a blank data before
21:25 < Nana> have you matched your other brackets elsewhere
21:25 < |31770|> Parse error: parse error, expecting `')'' in /u/cs/2/cs2om/public_html/buy.php on line 31 
21:25 < Nana> yeah 
21:25 < Nana> look before that
21:26 < Nana> you've missed one before and it's looking for that
21:26 < |31770|> nah i think the " are ending the string so it thinks there should be a ) before the string ends
21:26 < |31770|> i recon
21:26 < |31770|> just got to work out how to fix it
21:26 < Nana> ending what string?
21:27 < Nana> the string is the first argument
21:27 < |31770|>  www.bath.ac.uk/~cs2om/buy.txt
21:27 < |31770|> pritty recent doesnt have the date thing correct but u can see where it is
21:27 < Nana> no i cant!
21:27 < Nana> it's all on one long big line
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> ?
21:28 <@NoVisAnima> it's appeared correctly for me
21:28 < |31770|> view source
21:28 < Nana> oh thats better
21:28 <@NoVisAnima> you using IE?
21:28 < Nana> whereabouts was it screwing up
21:28 < |31770|> . getdate() .
21:29 < |31770|> which is now date("Y-m-d H.m.s", time())
21:29 < |31770|> but havnt updated the text, rest is the same though
21:29 < Nana> you don't need the ".
21:29 <@NoVisAnima> mm
21:29 < Nana> VALUES ($saleID," . getdate() .",  should be VALUES ($saleID, getdate(), ....
21:30 < Nana> otherwise it's literally going to print "getdate()" inside it
21:30 < Nana> oh wait...
21:30 <@NoVisAnima> i dont think so
21:30 < Nana> sorry i am wrong
21:30 <@NoVisAnima> there's a " 2 lines up
21:30 < |31770|> does that with Parse error: parse error in /u/cs/2/cs2om/public_html/buy.php on line 31 
21:31 < |31770|> wait might have fixed it
21:31 < Nana> ohhhh
21:31 < Nana> no
21:31 < Nana> you've used getdate wrongly
21:31 < Nana> you shouldn't be using getdate at all
21:31 < Nana> http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/function.getdate.php
21:31 < |31770|> [19:28] <|31770|> . getdate() .
21:31 < |31770|> [19:29] <|31770|> which is now date("Y-m-d H.m.s", time())
21:31 < Nana> getdate takes a timestamp as an argument
21:32 < Nana> oh :/
21:32 < |31770|> lol
21:32 < |31770|> ;)
21:32  * Nana should just shut up
21:32 <@NoVisAnima> *sigh*
21:32 < Nana> do you really want to store something already formatted
21:32 < Nana> why don't you store the timestamp and then format it when you want to use it
21:32 < Nana> it would be a lot better
21:33 <@NoVisAnima> yeah just get it out in the right format
21:33 < |31770|> the mysql database needs it in the form 0000-00-00 00.00.00 for it to work
21:33 < Nana> so change the database
21:33 < Nana> and make it a timestamp
21:33 <@NoVisAnima> exactly
21:33 < |31770|> bit late for that
21:33 < Nana> or a bigint (14)
21:33 < Nana> why?
21:33 <@NoVisAnima> it's not too late
21:33 < |31770|> its a date field
21:33 < Nana> so what
21:33 < Nana> just change it
21:33 <@NoVisAnima> you can change the column
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> just dont try doing it with mysql commands and get a nice gui ~:/
21:34 < |31770|> cause i didnt do the database bit of the coursework and the report has already been writen on that bit
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
21:34 < Nana> you can say it was a last minute alteration
21:34 < |31770|> + it due in on thurs
21:34 < |31770|> hens the slight hax in the code to get it working
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> yay for hax in the code
21:35 <@NoVisAnima> i had an entire page worth of haxs for one of them
21:35 <@NoVisAnima> and it worked
21:35 < |31770|> + dont think the its very secure as u can by pass the login just by typing the correct url lol
21:36 <@NoVisAnima> mmm i remember spending a while to put the security into ours
21:36 <@NoVisAnima> well our software project thing
21:36 < Nana> you could do an easy login thing
21:36 < Nana> just create a table with a username and a md5'ed password
21:36 < Nana> then ask them for it and look it up in the table
21:37 < Nana> and then use session's to check if they're logged in
21:37 <@NoVisAnima> what's that ' doing in sessions
21:37 < Nana> who cares
21:37 < |31770|> ???
21:37 <@NoVisAnima> (i'm back at home and my sister has been keeps going on about correct use of english)
21:38 < Nana> well sorry i have been at work all day
21:38 <@NoVisAnima> sorry
21:38  * NoVisAnima shuts up
21:39 < |31770|> got most of the session stuff there just not the bit that test if u are logged in on each page
21:39 < Nana> er....what *else* would you have for a session?
21:39 < Nana> it only has to be an integer
21:39 < |31770|> yeh im storing the user id
21:39 < Nana> like if($_SESSION['loggedin'] == 1) {//do stuff} else { boot them off }
21:40 < |31770|> i know but i got some strait html pages and cba to change them
21:40 < |31770|> something else to put in the report
21:40 < |31770|> would just error if u tryed to do anything without being logged in anyway as half the code uses ur user ID
21:41 < |31770|> keep getting duplicate key errors :/
21:42 < |31770|> but the data is going into the table correctly
21:46 <@NoVisAnima> oh Nana i had the same kind of hardware problem you had earlier, the same fixing method worked (opening case and blowing stuff) 
21:46 <@NoVisAnima> i wouldn't have thought of doing that usually ~:)
