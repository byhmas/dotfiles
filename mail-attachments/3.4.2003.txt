1. Opening the meeting
   -The meeting was opened at 6:12 pm

2. Accepting the Agenda
   -The agenda was approved

3. Past, present and future activities
   -Esport Night 21.3: about 15 people went, mostly people who knew Niina
    from before
   -Movie night 24.3: Man without a Past was a good movie, not everyone 
    liked Rentun Ruusu. There could be another movie night arranged with 
    Swedish movies (such as Jalla-Jalla)
   
   -Guided tour to the Botanical Garden 4.4: 23 people have signed up
   -Finnish cooking course 5-6.4: the courses will be arranged in Aurora 
    and are full
   -Guided tour to Finlandia: only 11 people have signed up, and there 
    should be 25 people in order to make it with the economy. Johanna will 
    try to get more people from other organizations as well. If there 
    aren't enough people, ESN will pay the rest.
   -AGM After Party 12.4: Kirsi will go, maybe Minttu as well.
   -Anna's trip to Russia started today (3.4.). She has been informing 
    people well about the trip so that they know what to expect.
   -Anna will send an e-mail about the tour to the Parliament (15.4) when 
    she has returned from her trip to Russia
   -Nuuksio: There will be two trips to Nuuksio, the first one on the 21st 
    of April, and the second one on the 17th-18th of May. Lots of foreign 
    students have been enthusiastic about the trips.
   -Porvoo: The trip starts at about 10 am with Jukka's bus. The bus will 
    cost 45 euros, plus 60 cents per km. There will eventually be a picnic 
    in Porvoo. Riikka is open to ideas about the trip.
   -Sitz party 24.4: At the moment only 3 people have signed up, but it 
    shouldn't be a big problem to get more. Johanna will ask if we can 
    borrow plates etc. from HYY. Music equipment has been reserved, we'll 
    get some alcohol from Russia.
   -Football: There are already three national teams, and there probably is
    an international team to come.
   -Vappu: There will be something traditional again. We'll inform foreign 
    students about parties
   -City Rally and Bye-Bye party 8.5: These will be planned in Wave on the 
    15th of April
   -ESN Committee picnic will probably be arranged on the 8th of June
   -Outi wants to go somewhere with Jukka's bus
   -Wave: it should be ready in a couple of weeks. The 22nd of April is a 
    possible date for a special pub night

   -There could be different kinds of trips to Russia: Drinking trips and 
    culture trips. People want different things from the trips anyway.

4. AGM 2004 greetings
   -Socrates application: We applied for 48 000 euros, and the budget for 
    AGM 2004 is set to 80 000 euros. The application was very long and 
    difficult to write. It will take a very long time before we get to know 
    if we get the money or not.
   -Vanha has been reserved for the Gala Evening
   -The Erottajanpuisto Hostel has been preliminary reserved
   -Riikka and Kirsi have applied for the job as project secretary. In 
    total there have been 3 or 4 applications.

5. International Tutoring
   -There has been an e-mail on the mail list that the University are 
    looking for international tutors
   -There should be a questionnaire for the old international tutors, but 
    we hope that the new project secretary will take care of that
   -At least Minttu and Anna have applied for the post as project secretary 
    for the international tutoring and buddy project

6. WWW-pages for Finnish Students
   -There will be a meeting during the spring about the www-pages, but the 
    date is not decided yet

7. ESN Leaflets & Questionnaires
   -there could be three kinds of leaflets: for foreign students, for 
    Finnish students and for foreign students who participate in the 
    Finnish course in August. There could also be a leaflet for the Buddy
    Project.
   -Questionnaires: Questionnaires should be made for foreign students, 
    international tutors and the buddy project. People who fill in the 
    questionnaires could get some free alcohol at the bye-bye party.
   -There will be a leaflet - questionnaire meeting on the 28th of April
    at 5 pm.

8. Bulletin Board
   -The Bulletin Board is technically ready for the big public. A couple 
    of test people have said that it's clear and easy to use. We'll just
    have to check if HYY has anything against the Bulletin Board and check 
    with the computer people, and it'll be ready.

9. Miscellaneous
   -Things look good for the language course in August. About 40 people 
    will take part in it, and the planning will be in the middle of July.
   -Diana Ben-Aaron has told us that students can translate some articles
    from Finnish into English. If we want to have articles from 
    Ylioppilaslehti, we'd have to ask the author of the article first. 
    Diana was willing to do this. There was an idea that foreign students 
    who receive some of their material only in Finnish could have it
    translated into English by Diana's students. Diana will have a new 
    group of students next semester, so it won't be actual until then.
   -Something should be done to the Partner Project before June. People 
    who went to Italy could maybe do something?
   -Outi will move, and have a housewarming party for people in the ESN 
    committee
   -We discussed about HYY in general and our role there. We have got the 
    feeling that ESN could do a lot more than just arrange parties and 
    trips. In general we know very little about what different 
    international things are done in HYY, and therefore we'd like to have 
    Jussi to one meeting to tell us about it.

10. Next meetings
   -The next meeting will be held on the 16th of April at 6 pm in Aurora
   -The meeting after that will be held on the 29th of April at 6 pm in 
    Floora

11. Closing of the meeting
   -The meeting was closed at 7:46 pm
