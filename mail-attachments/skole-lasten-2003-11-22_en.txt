1. Purpose

This document contains the requirements for the skolelinux school server from
teacher's point of view. These requirements should be outlined in a
comprehensive way. Based on this work statement the product requirement
specifications will be made. The work statement was compiled by members of the
German Skolelinux mailing list.

3 System maintenance

3.1 Server installation

The amount of questions are reduced to only the really necessary ones.
Installation on the hard drive (partitioning, formatting, installation,
hardware detection, ...) should be automatically when possible. An administrator
should easily be able to install an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

3.1.1 Easy standard install

3.1.2 Flexible manual install

For advanced users, it should be possible to install Skolelinux manually, for
instance to tightly integrate Skolelinux in an existing network.

3.1.3 Print server

The print server should allow easy installation and configuration of printers.

3.1.4 User administration

Every user should get an account. Every user should get only the needed rights.
The principle of the minimum user rights should be followed.

3.1.5 Administration of user accounts

Administration of user accounts should be customised to the special
requirements of the type of schools. All users should be able to change their
own password. Privileged teachers should be able to change pupils passwords.

The account data should be easily updated when a new school year start.

When removing user accounts, it should be possible to save the user data for a
limited time.

3.1.6 Monitoring the disk usage

It should be possible to get an clear overview of the used disk space.

3.1.7 Controlling the print server

It should be possible to specify which user may access which printer. The
selection of several printers should be possible. It should be possible to
assign a user the right to disable and enable printers, as well as stopping and
deleting printer jobs. Each user should be able to delete its own printing
jobs. It should be possible to configure that users printing jobs are removed
when they log off.

3.1.8 examination/tests environment

During examinations / tests, it should be possible to easily to prevent any
communications between pupils.

3.2 Data security

It should be possible to make both complete and differential backups.

3.3 Security updates

The newest security updates for the entire system should be possible to install
easily and fast.

3.4 Software administration

Easy installation and removal of software must be ensured. Updating of single
packages should also be possible.

3.5 Remote maintenance

All administration should be possible to do remotely using a secure connection.

3.6 Upgrading

Upgrading to the newest version should be possible to do safely and without any interruption.

3.7 Migration

Replacing existing Windows and Linux servers should be possible.

4 Server services

The administrative tasks should be possible to delegate by the access right system.

All sensitive data (authentication) should only be exchanged using encryption.


%%% What does this mean ?
The use of the preconfigured services should be possible to configured for each user.

4.1 Internet access

Access to Internet should be possible to allow and disallow based on the room, PC or user.

Access to unwanted websites should be possible to stop. Maintenance of the filters should be easy. 

During classes, it should be possible to enable monitoring of pupils surfing. It should also be possible to log all surfing activity. [LEGAL?]
%%% Horrible requirement ! :/

4.2 The local web server

The locale web server should let all users publish static and dynamic web
pages. When the responsible teacher has checked the individual web pages, the
pages should be possible to make public available.

% What does checking entail/mean ?

It should be possible to upload some web pages to an external webserver using a
encrypted connection.

4.3 The email server

The email server should enable local and external email. The access right
should be configured in the user administration. It should be possible to
integrate a virus scanner. For use in the German speaking parts of the world,
it should exist an interface to the Winshuttle service.

% Is a virus scanner needed with a Linux system? What is Winshuttle??

4.4 The news server

A local news server should provide selected news groups. The write and read
access should be configured in the user administration.

% User administration? Is this the same as the Teacher? And the Administrator? 
% Consistency! :)

4.5 The file server

Every user should get their own home directory. The size of the directories
should be configured in the user administration.

4.5.1 Exchange directories

It should be possible to create directories for exchanging files for members of
classes, rooms and projects. The maximum size should be possible to configure.

4.5.2 Retrieve directory

Here teachers, course and project leaders should place data to the pupils.

% I.e. their (Teacher's) homepage? or a specific course page?

4.5.3 Delivery directory

Here pupils should be able to deliver finished documents and data. This
directory should not be readable by other pupils. Teachers should easily be
able to fetch and move these documents and data.

% Why not email?
% Or delivery on paper. :)

4.6 The print server

A print server should receive the printing jobs, and it should be able to limit
and log the number of pages printed per user.

% Couldn't this be under 3.1.7

4.7 Mailing list server

For communicating within groups, for email projects [what is that?] and for
newsletter for websites for parents, pupil representatives, school management,
working groups and projects, a mailing list server should be available.

4.8 Wiki

For group work, a Wiki should be available.

% Yay!

4.9 The forum

A forum (portal) should be available.

% EH?

5 Documentation

Documentation customised for the intended audience is required and should be be
made available as an admin and user handbook, and documentation to distribute
together with SL [?? - Begleitmaterial].

5.1 Administration handbook

The administration handbook is about installation of the basis system.

Configuration of server services, user administration, maintenance and security, updating and upgrading of the system, and an FAQ.

5.2 User handbook

The user handbook contains all what users of the system (i.e. not administrators) need to know.

5.3 Begleitmaterial [what is that?]

Didactic -material to use the installed software pedagogically.
