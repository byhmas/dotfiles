SPEAKER POINT SCALE

Amended from the American Parliamentary Debate Association rules


Below 16	Horrible. Judges will not generally award points in this range unless the speaker, in addition to being unpersuasive and incomprehensible, was deliberately rude or offensive.

16 to 17	Very poor speech. Speaker has serious difficulty maintaining a coherent argument and expressing thoughts; speech ends well before allotted time.

18 to 20	Poor speech. Difficulty in expression and analysis; arguments unpersuasive; does not entirely fill time.

21 to 22	Below average. Speaker is lacking in one or more of the above listed areas.

23 to 24	Average. Generally competent speech; perhaps some minor flaws; unexceptional.

25	Good. Speaker is persuasive and presents material well. Speaker shines in one or two areas.

26	Excellent. No noticeable flaws in presentation or delivery. Persuasive analysis; effective refutation; expert presentation and polished speaking style. A speaker averaging a 26 in every round will most probably finish in the top five of the tournament.

27	Outstanding. Speaker excels in all areas; speech had a tremendous impact on the round; flawless presentation. One of the best speeches of the tournament. A speaker averaging a 27 every round will almost certainly be among the top two or three speakers of the tournament.

28	Among the best speeches you have ever heard. If any speaker finishes with a 28 average, he or she will almost certainly be named the best speaker of the tournament.

29	The best speech you have ever heard. Left you in tears. On the level of the best of Winston Churchill or Martin Luther King. Extraordinarily rare.

30	The best speech ever given in the history of the world, period. Remember the monolith in Space Odyssey 2001? If it took up debating and gave a speech it might be a 30. It is highly doubtful that you will be seeing any.
