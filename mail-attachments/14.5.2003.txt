1. Opening of the meeting

   The meeting was declared open at 6.10 pm

2. Approving the agenda

   The agenda was approved, with the following changes: AGM Project 
   Greetings was moved before item 4 (Autumn 2003) and another item was 
   added (item 5, Buddy project + International tutors).

3. Past, present and future events (in the spring term)

   -30.4 (Vappu): about 30 people came to see Manta
   -1.5: a few people came to the picnic. ESN could buy a tent so that 
    picnicking in rain would be more pleasant
   -Football: there were 6 teams in two divisions, and the budget went    
    even. 
   -Finnish Baseball: There were 6 people present, which was quite a small 
    number. More people would be welcome, and it was considered to change
    the day to Sunday (but Hanni can't come then). 
   -5.5 trip to Western Uusimaa: It was a nice trip with 33 people
   -7.5 meeting for responsibles for international affairs of the subject 
    organisations: The meeting was good and needed. There will be a Nation 
    orienteering together with the Finnish people. The subject       
    organisations will also be present in the Cityrally, and the 
    organisations could have some kind of presentations at pub nights.
   -8.5 Cityrally: 3 teams of 2 people each came. The advertisement of the 
    Cityrally didn't work quite well this time. It was also wondered if the 
    Cityrally is necessaary in spring.
   -8.5 Bye-Bye party: There was a good show, but problems with the DJ. 
    Someone said that it was the best ESN-party of the year!
   -9.5 international brunch was nice
   -13.5 Special pub night: Things looked bad in the beginning, there were 
    some technical problems and no-one was there... But later on lots of
    people came and had a good time. Another pub responsible is needed!

   -15.5 there will be the outgoing students info, taken care of by Outi.
   -17-18.5 trip to Nuuksio. 33 people have signed up.
   -21.5 Sauna evening in Otaniemi. It will begin at 7 pm, ESN of the HUT 
    will buy the drinks, ESN Helsinki the food. Pancakes will be made, and 
    sausages will be sold. Girls will be in the big sauna between 7 and 8 
    pm, and boys from 8 to 9 pm, after that there's mixed sauna. Tytti will 
    send the info to the FS-list and Riikka can get the food, but she'll 
    need help with carrying the things.
   -8.6 ESN picnic at 1 pm in Suomenlinna.

The spring term was full of program, which was good! ESN Sports was 
enjoyed, the excursion to the airport, and the fact that there were lots of 
different activities. We still miss more new active people, and the filling 
of all kinds of applications (for AGM) was rather exhausting.

4. AGM Project Greetings

   -there is a preliminary schedule for AGM
   -there is also a list of things that have to be done. Kirsi and Riikka 
    are taking care of lots of things. Webpages (even bad ones) are needed 
    urgently.
   -The next AGM meeting will be held on the 21st of May at 2 pm in meeting 
    room Floora. There will possibly be a meeting in summer, but at least 
    in August.
   -sponsor letters are being written and more are needed. People who 
    manage to get a sponsor will be awarded.

5. Buddy Project + International tutors
   -there will be an international tutor training session on the 27th of 
    May at 2 pm. Things like Unicard, HKL, HYY and ESN will hopefully be 
    treated.
   -the tutors will work in small groups of 5-10 people, and people are 
    needed to take care of these groups
   -there are camps for international tutors in August. International 
    tutors are emphasized to take part in the second camp (15-17.8)

Buddy Project - Kaveri kaikille! :)
   -there have been some interested people (thanks to the announcement in 
    Ylioppilaslehti)
   -the registration form will look different, more details of what people 
    would like to do is asked for, and the groups made according to that

7. Partner Section Project

Nothing has really happened. A t-shirt would be cool, maybe in autumn? Even 
though the partner section project has been lame lately, we still want to 
keep it going.
