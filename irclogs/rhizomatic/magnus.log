13:23 -!- Irssi: Starting query in rhizomatic with Magnus
13:23 <hendry> do what? :)
13:23 <Magnus> 1) I'll set dabox to run DNS
13:23 <Magnus> 1a) www.prazefarm to point wherever it is now
13:24 <Magnus> 1b) new.prazefarm to point to dabox
13:24 <Magnus> 2) you use your domain registrar to point to dabox
13:24 <Magnus> 3) I'll set up MT on dabox, and give you full control
13:24 <hendry> Cool
13:24 <hendry> http://kiv.ath.cx/~hendry/praze/
13:24 <Magnus> 4) you build new.prazefarm as you like
13:24 <hendry> I am writing a page for my parents here
13:24 <hendry> But I'd rather leverage MT
13:24 <Magnus> 5) you tell me to switch it whenever
13:24 <Magnus> MT is great
13:25 <hendry> Ok, DrHyde is hosting prazefarm.co.uk for me atm
13:25 <hendry> Can't you do a pop for my sister?
13:25 <Magnus> possibly
13:25 <hendry> Or maybe I can just redirect the WWW to dabox?
13:25 <Magnus> brb
13:25 <hendry> Trying to think of the easiest way to do this...
13:29 <Magnus> what are you saying now
13:30 <Magnus> email addresses @prazefarm.co.uk can be redirected anywhere you like
13:30 <hendry> My sister gets her mail through a pop provided by David Cantrell who atm hosts prazefarm.co.uk
13:31 <hendry> If we move it to dabox, the same thing needs to be setup at dabox in order for my sister to have no problems right?
13:31 <Magnus> then we can leave the mx as it is
13:31 <hendry> Ok, mx is for mail ? :)
13:31 <hendry> So what needs to change?
13:32 <Magnus> I'll have a look later
13:32 <Magnus> email me magnus@huckvale.net so I have your latest addy
