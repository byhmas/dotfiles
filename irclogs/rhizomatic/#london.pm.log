13:35 <@TeeJay> gbjk: yeah - no shadow kick looks like a crescent kick with a leading leg
13:35 <@gbjk> Didn't Realise that Wong Fei-Hung's father was also one of the ten tigers of Canton
13:36 <@TeeJay> yes - he also invented the Tiger-Crane form of Hung Gar
13:36 <@aef> It's funny how the directors of a company have a duty to act in the interests of their shareholders at any given time. Which includes inflating the share price so they can sell it to some other person and make a profit, which the next person pays for, though they are also a shareholder now. Because they weren't when the decision to inflate was made.
13:37 <@gbjk> Yo Ming Guek
13:37 <@gbjk> TeeJay: yeah - I knew that
13:37 <@gbjk> TeeJay: Didn't that proceed the Fujian version ?
13:37 <@gbjk> he was from Fushan, wasn't he .. which is a neighbouring province ?
13:37 <@TeeJay> gbjk: no - tis a form not a style
13:37 <@TeeJay> yeah neighbouring province
13:38 <@TeeJay> but chinese province are large
13:38 <@gbjk> TeeJay: I know
13:38 <@TeeJay> crane and tiger are common combination
13:38 <@gbjk> TeeJay: that's true

13:53 <@aef> It's sold by the litre, nowadays...
13:53 <@Magnus> hahahah
13:53 <@Magnus> I was in a coffee shop/bar on Wednesday night
13:53 <@Magnus> they had vintage gramophones from the 20's and 50's playing
13:53 <@Magnus> and my mate asked for a Latte
13:53 <@Magnus> so I went down to order it
13:54 <@yoda> marnameow: leave work and find a nice coffee shop :)
13:54 <@Magnus> and the girl asked small/medium/large
13:54 <@Magnus> I asked how big the large was
13:54 <@Magnus> and she showed me
13:54 <@Magnus> and I said "surely that's a fatal dose of caffeine"
13:54 <@Magnus> and she looked completely blank
13:54 <@aef> Magnus: And then you seduce her?
13:54 <@bob> Magnus: no that about 10 grams
13:54 <@doop> 50mg/kg AFAIR
13:54 <@Magnus> but.... it's funny, right?
13:55 <@Magnus> she was foreign.
13:55 <@Magnus> the gramophones were good though
13:57 <@marnameow> But did you seduct her?
13:57 <@Magnus> no
13:57 <@Magnus> it only works on people that are responsive
13:57 <@TeeJay> Magnus: not fast enough
13:58 <@marnameow> Did you *attempt* to seduct her?
13:59 <@Magnus> sigh
13:59 <@PerfDave> "Responsive"? You mean you can pull anybody who wants to be pulled?
14:00 <@lathos> Did you threaten to overrule her?
14:00 <@Magnus> ok it wasn't really a fastseduction story
14:00 <@Magnus> it was a coffee story
14:00 <@PerfDave> I'm easily seduced by coffee

14:09 <@lathos> Just as well we didn't though; I appreciated being able to Get Stuff Done.
14:09 <@davorg> he was coming from Bath and got caught up in the train chaos

14:30 <@davorg> rataxis: i had mexican food in san diego. does that count?
14:30 < rataxis> not generally incredibly spicy
14:30 <@TeeJay> same goes for greek food
14:30 <@TeeJay> most greek restaurants in the UK have shit food compared to greece itself
14:30 < rataxis> davorg : I've no idea. If it was somewhere that mexicans went to eat then probably.
14:31 < rataxis> i mean, SD is at least v close to mexico.
14:31 <@AlexMc> TeeJay: I hardly recognise greek food in the UK
14:31 <@davorg> it was where californians went to eat
14:31 < rataxis> ah.
14:31 <@davorg> but it was staffed by mexicans
14:31 < rataxis> *every* restaurant in .us is staffed by mexicans
14:31 <@AlexMc> admittedly I lived in Cyprus which has its own style of greek food, but frankly nothing compares to the foo my mum and grandma makes
14:31 < rataxis> they're cheap, reliable, don't have huge egos, and can really cook.
14:32 <@davorg> mexican food in the uk might not be authenically mexican, but i still really like it

14:46 <@muttley> anyone know of a good page comparing cost of owener ship of sun hardware vs x86 server hardware
14:47 <@Greg> i'm sure both sun and dell/compaq can provide you with pages like that
14:48 <@Greg> they may of course vary in their comparisons
14:49 < rataxis> heh, yes.
14:50 < rataxis> muttley : to some extent, it depends on what you'll use the things for.
14:51 <@lathos> "New Zealand's farmers have criticised a proposed tax on the flatulence emitted by their sheep and cattle"
14:51 < rataxis> i'm inclined to suggest that a pair of E10Ks will have lower ongoing maintenance costs than a cluster of P4 servers
14:51 < rataxis> but the sun hardware might be twice as expensive for roughly equivalent processing power.
14:52 < rataxis> OTOH the Sun boxen might be better at your application than the PCs - it depends what they'll be doing.
14:52 < rataxis> or is that not what you were asking?

14:58 <@muttley> rataxis: somebody on a nother list was asking why Unix people complain about the cost of software and trumpet [Ff]ree software then go out and "pay through the nose for Sun hardware"
14:58 <@muttley> I'm trying to explain that whilst x86 maybe cheap, as server hardware it doth verily suck donkey wang
14:59 <@Greg> it depends on the application
14:59 <@Shevek> Xeon easily outperforms Sparc for web hosting.
14:59 <@muttley> Greg: true
14:59 <@muttley> but performance isn't everything
15:00 <@Greg> i tend to think that the problem with linux is the admins are of a lower standard than solaris/aix admins
15:00 <@mstevens> whenever I've compared intel / sparc for web hosting / running perl code, I've always seen better performance from intel
15:00 <@gellyfish> yes you have to have loads of flashing lights as well
15:01 <@Greg> but web applications are pretty non-demanding apps even with crack addled perl programmers involved
15:01 <@Greg> look at databases that need multigigabyte main memory to even consider working at solaris/sun/oracle starts to look a lot more appealing

15:07 <@AlexMc> Kake: ha ha ha, I get the odd MS Windows software developer sending me his CV. sometimes I even reply
15:08 <@mstevens> davorg: but I liked using ASE at work enough to want to consider buying ASA for personal use.
15:08 <@davorg> AlexMc: i often reply asking why they've sent a Word document to an open source company
15:08 <@davorg> i never get a responce :)
15:09 <@davorg> oh. looks like they've renamed it again. SQL Anywhere Studio
15:09 <@davorg> http://www.sybase.com/products/anywhere
15:10 <@davorg> rebranding--
15:16 <@hex> me++ # getting stuff done
15:17 <@mstevens> me-- # not getting stuff done
15:17 <@yoda> me-- # watching a dvd instead of reinstalling my laptop

15:21 <@Magnus> nooooooooooooooo
15:21 <@Magnus> I know who dies in Harry Potter 5
15:22 <@bob> Magnus: hopefulyl all of them
15:22 <@aef> Mmm.
15:22  * aef seems to now have a weekend and no plans for it.
15:22 <@bob> aef: sit int eh sun and do noting
15:23 <@aef> Mmm. Could do.
15:23 <@aef> Should also tidy the house, learn C++, learn Java and do some coding.
15:23 <@aef> And go to the gym some more.
15:23 <@bob> aef: meh sounds far to much liek hard work
15:24 <@aef> I have a flatmate moving in at the end of the month. But me tidy by then.
15:24 <@noidd> tell me magnus
15:24 <@noidd> who dies
15:24 <@noidd> ?
15:24 <@noidd> hopefully the whiney bitch
15:25 <@marnameow> Magnus, you should really tell everyone you meet. It's your duty to be evil-spoiler-boy!
15:25  * noidd wants to know
15:25 <@noidd> by message if you have to
15:26 <@noidd> just tell me damnit
15:26 <@Magnus> haha I could go to the midnight opening of waterstones with it on my t-shirt
15:26 <@Magnus> msg noidd Dumbledore
15:26 <@Magnus> oh arse
15:26 <@noidd> that would be HILLARIOUS
15:26 <@Magnus> I'd get beaten up
15:27 <@noidd> would be funny as hell tho ;-0
15:27 <@aef> Magnus: Do it.
15:27 <@aef> dipsy?
15:27 <+dipsy> yes, aef?
15:27 <@aef> Mmm.
15:27  * TeeJay is picking up a load of empty boxes from his local bookshop early saturday morning
15:27 <@TeeJay> perfect for packing my books into
15:30 <@Dom2> aaaaaaaaargh
15:30 <@Dom2> database are making my life hard again
15:35 <@yoda> what's the problem this time?
15:36 <@Magnus> poor old greg
15:36 <@Magnus> doesn't know his harry potter
15:36  * CPAN upload: Compress-LZW-0.01 by MHOWARD
15:40  * TeeJay is tempted by head-first into java
15:40 <@TeeJay> hmmm 50's imagery
15:46 <@TeeJay> anyone done QT with c++ ?
15:46  * TeeJay imagines QT would be a good way to learn C++
15:46 <@Dom2> TeeJay: I have the book at home
15:46 <@TeeJay> Dom2: but is QT icky or not ?
15:46 <@TeeJay> GTK is ok
15:47 <@TeeJay> but only because I am a C hacker at heart
15:47 <@Magnus> davorg: that dns comic is incorrect anyway
15:47  * TeeJay has tried to learn c++ about 3 times
15:47 <@doop> I have as well; I keep going back to C or perl or both.
15:47 <@TeeJay> I usually get to the point where it would all be so much easier in a different language
15:48 <@doop> Trying to learn from tutorials on the web which turn out to use non-ANSI-isms doesn't help.
15:48 <@TeeJay> nah - just having problems that are easier solved using something else
15:48 <@itz> most of the OO freaks I have met dislike C++ and prefer Obj C although things are supposed to be better with STL
15:48  * TeeJay still laughs that Zeus made their own STL
15:49 <@TeeJay> they really are fruitcakes tho
15:49 <@mstevens> teejay: I bet it was fast and reliable, tho.
15:49 <@TeeJay> probably
15:49 <@TeeJay> the interview quiz involved things like the start of the unix epoch
15:50 <@TeeJay> 100 tech trivia questions - good fun
15:50 <@mstevens> teejay: The question I remember from the zeus interview was the speed of sound in air at sea level
15:50 <@mstevens> there was also some math trivia in there IIRC
15:50 <@TeeJay> yup
15:50 <@doop> You were supposed to remember that (~300m/s) or work it out?
15:50 <@itz> arent these exactly the sort of facts people look up rather than remember?
15:51 <@TeeJay> itz: some of the harder ones were ' what is significant about this number'
15:51 <@mstevens> doop: probably remember, the num questions / time was such you weren't supposed to finish, and didn't have time to do any calculations
15:51 <@TeeJay> its one way of seeing if you really are a geek or not
15:51 <@mstevens> teejay: the other ones I remember were "who is our CEO", and, from the verbal interview, "How do you hack root on a unix system" (which I have shamelessly nicked)
15:52  * TeeJay had 30 seconds to design a HA web site system
15:53  * TeeJay should have put ' I have no interests in IT, especially nothing hard' in his CV
15:53 <@mstevens> teejay: I think I got harassed about high performance, rather than high availablity.
15:53  * TeeJay mentioned he was interested in HA
15:53 <@TeeJay> never again
15:54 <@itz> maybe you should have asked back "why would anyone buy zeus when apache is free"? :)
15:54 <@TeeJay> itz: some good reasons
15:54 <@mstevens> teejay: I made lots of stupid comments about ways to make high performance web servers which the guy  interviewing me apparently thought were terrible.
15:54 <@TeeJay> like ISAPI on UNIX
15:54 <@TeeJay> mstevens: did the same, oh well
15:55 <@TeeJay> like how to load balance ssl effectively
15:55 <@mstevens> teejay: I never found out if I'd have gotten the job, because iii made me an offer before zeus made a decision
15:55  * TeeJay didn't - was too lame
15:55 <@TeeJay> :(
15:55 <@chrisc> load balancing ssl is tricky
15:55 <@TeeJay> chrisc: zeus and some cisco things shared a cache for ssl keys or something
15:56 <@chrisc> yep
15:56 <@TeeJay> would have been good to know that before the interview
15:56  * TeeJay read up on c/C++ before the interview only to have no questions on either
15:56  * TeeJay doesn't swot before interviews anymore
15:57 <@chrisc> no point
15:57 <@Greg> i think about them
15:57 <@Greg> i'm very literal here
15:57 <@chrisc> swot up about the company, but techie stuff you either know or you don't
15:57 <@Greg> before an interview i will think about it and imagine it
15:58 <@noidd> Silly Question: has anyone ever seen/read the Threepenny Opera?

16:06 <+dipsy> vorsprun1?
16:10 <@TeeJay> debian, whats the worst that could happen ?
16:11 <@Dom2> TeeJay: endless time spent configuring the fucker
16:12 <@TeeJay> Dom2: or apt-get force install package
16:13 <@TeeJay> holy dependancies batman!
16:13 <@Dom2> TeeJay: It'll still ask you 300 questions about whether your want the package in pink or purple
16:13 <@Dom2> instead of providing you with a default
16:13 <@Dom2> and then like you say it'll suck up all your bandwidth pulling down obscure dependencies
16:14  * TeeJay just twats debian with the enter key until it submits to his will
16:14 <@Dom2> Damn, I'm bitter today
16:17 <@TeeJay> I see somebody got caught in the reply-to-list CV trap - har har!
16:18 <@TeeJay> all MLM should come with CV catchers
16:18 <@Dom2> "Oh No Not Again"
16:18 <@TeeJay> maybe that could be Siesta's killer featuer
16:19 <@TeeJay> with option strings2html for the archive
16:19 <@chrisa> what, puts them into a special 'fools' archive?
16:19 <@Dom2> I think siesta's killer feature will be an oreillynet.com article
16:19 <@Dom2> closely followed by "lots of users".
16:19 <@TeeJay> who do I twat at ora to get an osdir write up for autodia ?
16:19 <@richardc> :)
16:19 <@Dom2> TeeJay: no idea
16:20  * TeeJay could of course look at osdir
16:20 <@richardc> I think you could be right there.  it does seem to draw people in
16:20 <@Dom2> TeeJay: sorry, try Steve Mallet
16:20 <@TeeJay> har har har!

16:23 <@itz> which linux distro works just randomly depends on which drivers are in it and what hardware you have
16:23 <@Dom2> TeeJay: my mind is blown
16:23 <@TeeJay> itz: suse is pretty hot for hardware support out of the box
16:23 <@TeeJay> always has been
16:24 <@TeeJay> its just a bit, well, german
16:24 <@richardc> Kake: depends.  if we got a bunch of people trying to use Siesat right now, then result would be a lot of people pissed off and confused
16:24 <@itz> true but what I said still stands
16:24 <@itz> its just rolling dice
16:24 <@gellyfish> richardc, how would that be different from the status quo
16:24 <@Kake> Don't mind mel I'm just being bitter.  I think I shall go and have a cup of tea.

16:26 <@TeeJay> Dom2: there be a big firewall in the way - can you put them somewhere reachable by http ?
16:26 <@TeeJay> itz: yeah so did I, she was a cornish artist who lived in a tower
16:27 <@gellyfish> I am actually acquainted with David Allen

16:29 <@itz> I always prefered hawkwing to gong anyway because they were louder
16:29 <@gellyfish> itz, yes
16:29 <@Dom2> itz: The nice thing about hawkwind is that when you went to one of their gigs you didn't have to look at the fuckers because there was so much smoke
16:30 <@itz> dom2: they were always different fuckers on stage anyway apart from Mr Brock himself
16:33 <@TeeJay> itz: true - but see smoke in the way
16:34  * TeeJay necked an eigth of cannabis resin before going in to watch hawkwind
16:34 <@TeeJay> felt quite ill at the end of the evening

16:39 <@Elthek> Okie.
16:39 <@itz> magnus: $$$$$
16:40 <@Dom2> TeeJay: Oh, I wouldn't go that far...
16:40 <@Magnus> itz: no, I don't see why you'd think that.
16:40 <@richardc> it's about 9 quid, available in all good bookshops now
16:40 <@Greg> Magnus: buddhism
16:40 <@Magnus> warner are milking it for all they can
16:40 <@Magnus> but rowling isn't writing it for the money
16:41 <@gellyfish> ooh suuuuuuuure
16:41 <@Magnus> I'm not interested in cynical views on that
16:41 <@itz> has anyone bothered to download any of the alleged P2P versions of the new one?
16:41 <@Magnus> all fake
16:41 <@gellyfish> no
16:41  * muttley thinks Harry Potter is about various, errm, social groups finally realising that kids don't *actually* like books about 12 year single mums and their relationships with their 25 year old tower block crack dealing boyfriends
16:41 <@Magnus> she says there is an overall point, that no-one has quite hit apon yet
16:41 <@Greg> im not sure if she is or not, but i _know_ she is interested in exploring non-commercial side events
16:41 <@muttley> lol @ 'FORTRAN compilers are more like "error, gorak think u program not working.  gorak consult rock and tree."'
16:41  * Greg waits on Elthek to challenge him
16:42 <@Magnus> muttley: what books are those?
16:42 <@Dom2> muttley: I though fortran compilers where all about "this doesn't look like assembly to me, you lose!"
16:42 <@TeeJay> Dom2: one of the bonzo dog doodah band came to our wedding
16:42 <@Magnus> I think there's a message in there for kids, about growing up, or about relating to your parents, or something
16:42 <@Magnus> Harry has lost his parents
16:42 <@Magnus> and in a way, all adolescents lose touch with their parents
16:43 <@marnameow>  There's a theme of growing up throughout them - but this is not at all unusual in childrens' books.
16:43 <@richardc> in surprise news, I'm speaking at YAPCX
16:44 <@Dom2> TeeJay: Really?  Wow!  Was that the one that appeared on buzzcocks?
16:44 <@Dom2> richardc: christmas island yapc?
16:44 <@marnameow> The parents thing is a little harder to pin down. There's not all that much family interaction in the books, so less to go on.
16:44 <@Magnus> marnameow: yes, I think rowling has something specifically to say about this generation, or hers
16:44 <@TeeJay> Dom2: don't know, probably not - he is going out with one of my wife's friends
16:45 <@marnameow> Magnus: What do you think she has to say?
16:45 <@richardc> Dom2: modem of death YAPC
16:45 <@gellyfish> I haven't even read all of Shakespeare yet why would I want to read Harry Potter?
16:45 <@TeeJay> but you don't *read* shakespeare
16:45 <@TeeJay> you watch it
16:45 <@Magnus> marnameow: not sure
16:45 <@TeeJay> or act it
16:45 <@aef> TeeJay: You don't _watch_ Shakespeare, you dig him up :
16:45 <@aef> :)
16:46  * TeeJay wishes that Oscar Wilde wrote more novels and less arty-farty poetry crap
16:46 <@gellyfish> TeeJay, er then how does one know what happens in the play if you don't read it ?
16:46 <@marnameow> Magnus: What do *you* think when you come away from reading the books. Straight after, when you finish, what's in your brane?
16:46 <@TeeJay> gellyfish: you pay attention to what happens on stage, duh!
16:46 <@marnameow> Shakespeare's *fun* to read. 
16:46 <@Magnus> marnameow: consciously, the emotional thrill ride of it all
16:46 <@gellyfish> HOW DO THE FUCKING ACTORS KNOW THEN SHIT FOR BRAINS
16:46 <@Magnus> marnameow: it's the sub-conscious message that interests me
16:47 <@TeeJay> they watch other actors, like, dug
16:47 <@chrisa> they keep bogging off into the wing to ask the prompt
16:48 <@marnameow> Magnus: There be schools of thort that say you need to construct your own message.
16:48 <@Dom2> dipsy, prompt?
16:48 <+dipsy> i haven't a clue, dom2
16:48 <@marnameow> So you could impose whatever meaning you wanted on the text.
16:48 <@Dom2> dipsy, prompt is <reply>It's your turn!
16:48 <+dipsy> OK, Dom2.
16:48 <@itz> whats a recursive (file) lock?
16:48 <@Magnus> marnameow: no, she's admitted she has something specific to say
16:48  * gellyfish mumbles something about the intentional fallacy and wanders off for a smoke
16:49 <@noidd> TeeJay: Shakespere wrote more than plays
16:49 <@Dom2> gellyfish has an internation phallus?
16:49 <@noidd> some of his best works I think were in his sonnets
16:49 <@noidd> and you have to read those
16:49 <@marnameow> Magnus: What did she say exactly?

16:52  * TeeJay sings o~ sound of the underground o~
16:54 <@itz> magnus: maybe if you manipulate all the words in the books using your own arbitary method you find a secret message?

16:58 <@marnameow> Magnus: But that's not definitely a *message* or meaning or whatever that you take from the book (which is what I thought you were looking for)?
16:58 <@mstevens> how do I do an outer join between table a and table b, and table a and table c, in SQL, using ANSI joins?
16:59 <@Magnus> marnameow: it's more the message to take from the whole 7 book series
16:59  * sphyg yawns
16:59 <@marnameow> It could be a neat plot twist that ties everything up.
16:59 <@noidd> we have anyone who can speak german here?
17:00 <@Magnus> marnameow: no, it's building a big picture
17:00 <@sphyg> marna: enoscrollback. what would?
17:00 <@aef> This is why SQL should use set notation, it's so much easier :)

17:01 <@gellyfish> ITYM 'Meaning'
17:01 <@gellyfish> of course it has 'meaning' or it wouldn't be readable
17:01 <@marnameow> Magnus: Well, yes. It would be a really shoddy series if there weren't overarching themes and plot. I mean, that's one of the *points*.
17:02 <@Magnus> sigh
17:02 <@marnameow> I think I might even have meant *MEANING*
17:02 <@Magnus> didn't you ever watch babylon 5?

17:02 <@Magnus> sphyg++
17:02  * davorg is sure there isn't any "meaning" in HP
17:02 <@marnameow> No, I didn't like B5.
17:02 <@davorg> i mean, it's just a kids book
17:02 <@gellyfish> I'm with davorg
17:02 <@Magnus> davorg: yes but you are blind to such things.
17:03 <@davorg> ?
17:03 <@davorg> why do you say that?
17:03 <@Magnus> you think the matrix is about cool fight scenes
17:03 <@Dom2> davorg: the meaning is "spend more on merchandising"
17:04 <@gellyfish> alterntatively Magnus is schizophrenic - seeing pattern in otherwise ambiguous material
17:04 <@Magnus> Dom2: no it's not, you're just cynical
17:04 <@Dom2> No, everybody knows that the matrix is about kittens
17:04 <@sphyg> dom: are you channeling marna?
17:04 <@marnameow> HP has meaning of a sort - it's almost painfully didactic in places.
17:04 <@Dom2> Keanu has just used hair gel to town down his fluff
17:04  * Magnus sighs
17:04 <@Dom2> sphyg: Ooops, might be
17:04 <@marnameow> And the books (the first four, at any rate) follow the same pattern.
17:05 <@Magnus> that's because they follow a year at school
17:05 <@davorg> Magnus: no the matrix is fight scenes with some tired philosophy and religious imagery thrown in to make idiots think it's "deep"
17:05 <@itz> davorg: true but it does it very well
17:06 <@Magnus> davorg: we've had this conversation, and you started asking me if I'd read books on philosophy that I read years ago
17:06 <@marnameow> Yes. But if you're going to go .khunting for meaning it's best to start with the obvious bits and that's a good starting point.
17:06 <@Magnus> davorg: and then I asked you if you'd read some that I've read more recently, and you hadn't
17:06 <@Magnus> davorg: but carry on, I'm sure I'm just stupid.
17:06 <@sphyg> marna: how was spike?
17:06 <@davorg> Magnus: i know. but that doesn't mean I'm blind to seeing the meaning. it means i saw it and dismissed it :)
17:06 <@marnameow> spike cannot sing all that well. And he didn't strip.
17:07 <@Magnus> davorg: so you lose.
17:07 <@marnameow> How does he lose?
17:07  * Magnus goes back to thinking about potter
17:08  * CPAN upload: Business-FedEx-DirectConnect-0.17 by JPOWERS
17:08 <@marnameow> Magnus, if you want to find deep-and-meaningfulness in books HP may not be the best starting point.
17:08 <@marnameow> And it's all just a construct in your brane. 
17:08 <@Dom2> I always preferred winnie the pooh for "deep and meaningful"
17:08 <@sphyg> i disagree
17:08 <@Magnus> marnameow: on the contrary, harry potter is the best starting point
17:08 <@davorg> i should blog my feelings on HP. I still don't understand why so many adults get so excited by it.
17:09 <@Magnus> followed by the chronicles of narnia
17:09 <@Dom2> davorg: because they all have dreary mundane lives with no imagniation
17:09 <@Magnus> and the pullman books
17:09 <@Dom2> davorg: I know I fall into that category :(
17:09 <@marnameow> ANd anything that Rowling put in as being deep is a construct in her brane.
17:09 <@Magnus> marnameow: well true
17:09 <@sphyg> scribot: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~lucifer/hp.html # why i like harry potter
17:09 <@marnameow> Magnus: Narnia would be a much better place to start because it's a lot more overt.
17:10 <@Magnus> marnameow: if you like
17:10 <@sphyg> narnis is old fashioned
17:11 <@itz> I liked narnia even although its just Christain nonsense
17:11 <@sphyg> (which doesn't mean it's not good)
17:11 <@gbjk> sphyg: how's you ?
17:11 <@gbjk> I'm driving past you on sunday
17:11 <@gbjk> then living just above you for a week or so
17:11 <@marnameow> I just think Potter kis a daft place to start because there's too much semi-written bumph around it to distract you, and the books lend themselves to branecandy reading rather than analysis.
17:11 <@sphyg> gbjk: how come?
17:12 <@gbjk> sphyg: staying with god parents for a weeks holiday
17:12 <@gbjk> :-)
17:12 <@Greg> great game Elthek 
17:12 <@davorg> narnia has meaning. it was written as allegory. HP has about as much meaning as the famous five.
17:12 <@Elthek> Greg: *bursts out laughing*
17:12 <@Greg> very competitive for us two
17:12 <@Elthek> 3.9 seconds!
17:12 <@gbjk> LMFAO
17:12 <@Greg> wonderful stuff
17:12 <@gbjk> What the hell ?
17:12 <@Elthek> Yep, I think that's the best you've ever played.
17:12 <@Elthek> gbjk: I won with 3.9 seconds on my clock.
17:12 <@sphyg> gbjk: if i'm not still moulting i'd say pub!
17:13 <@gbjk> Elthek: I only know three openings that pull that off !?
17:13 <@gbjk> Elthek: Smothered check ?
17:13 <@gbjk> moulting ?
17:13 <@Magnus> sphyg: how did the polyjuice episode later return to haunt harry?
17:13 <@Elthek> Uh, kinda.  I had two queens and he didn't have any.  :)
17:13 <@sphyg> magnus: er, lupin in goblet
17:13 <@gbjk> Elthek: I'm confused, in 3.9 seconds how the hell did you do THAT?
17:13 <@gbjk> sphyg: what's moulting
17:13 <@Greg> it was an incredible game
17:14 <@Elthek> gbjk: I didn't do anything in 3.9 seconds.  I had 3.9 seconds left when I checkmated.
17:14 <@gbjk> Elthek: How do I see the game ?
17:14 <@Elthek> Greg: It was.  :)
17:14  * Magnus is all for brain candy being used to feed people important concepts
17:14 <@sphyg> gbjk: sunburn
17:14 <@Magnus> sphyg: lupin?
17:14 <@gbjk> Elthek: Ah - nice
17:14 <@sphyg> magnus: dark arts teacher
17:14 <@Elthek> gbjk: Log in, exam elthek 35
17:14 <@Magnus> but what about the polyjuice
17:14 <@marnameow> Magnus: I'm just not convinced that there's an important concekpt in there.
17:14 <@gbjk> sphyg: sounds like a plan ... if I can drag the missus away from the shops
17:14 <@marnameow> And I'm not so hot on the idea of sneaking ideas in with the fun. 
17:14 <@Greg> i'd suggest watching it in real time towards the end if your client allows
17:14 <@Greg> it was a great game
17:14 <@Greg> thanks Elthek 
17:15 <@Magnus> marnameow: how about 'the little boy who cried wolf' or 'the rabbit and the hare'
17:15 <@Magnus> er
17:15 <@Magnus> 'the hare and the tortoise'
17:15 <@Greg> Elthek: i think i'm starting to remember enough chess to get somewhere near as good as i was when i was 12
17:15 <@marnameow> fables - yes. They're rather obvious.
17:15 <@sphyg> marna: so ideas can't be fun?
17:15 <@Elthek> Greg: Yes, haven't had a game that good in a long time, with anyone.
17:16  * Greg has a warm happy feeling after the game
17:16 <@Greg> very good
17:16 <@Greg> but i feel a bit hyper
17:16 <@Elthek> Hah.  You should have seen me making those queen moves.
17:16 <@Elthek> *click*click*click*click*click*click*
17:16 <@Kake> Elthek, which city are you in now?
17:17 -!- cwest [~Casey@209.195.191.8] has joined #london.pm
17:18 -!- mode/#london.pm [+o cwest] by slavorg
17:18 <@Elthek> Kake: Brighton.
17:18 <@Elthek> Then Cambridge on Monday, Boston on Wednesday.
17:18 <@Kake> Poo.
17:18 <@Dom2> Elthek: You're a high flying man. :)
17:18 <@Elthek> And I need to put an Oxford in there at some point, too.
17:18 <@sphyg> elthek; cambridge?
17:19 <@Elthek> sphyg: Yes!  Actually, I was going to see if I can bug you about crash space.  Giving a talk at the uni on Monday morning.
17:20 <@Elthek> sphyg: (I'm after crash space for sunday night so I don't have to get up at 6am to get there on time from Brighton.  It's okay if you're busy, Marna offered to let me stay at her place in London either.)
17:20 <@gbjk> Good Game Elthek and Greg :-)
17:20 <@Greg> it was fun wasnt it
17:21 <@sphyg> elthek: sure, mail me so i remember.  what's the talk?
17:21 <@noidd> ah well, back to working on the house
17:21 <@Greg> i reckon im about 2 months away from being able to give Elthek a good run for his money every time
17:21 <@gbjk> Sphyg: So you fancy a drink ?
17:22 <@Elthek> Greg: Christ, I made the last eight moves in under five seconds.  :)
17:22 <@Greg> yarr
17:22 <@gbjk> Sphyg: shall I try to ditch the gf to avoid spare wheel paranoia ? :D
17:22 <@Greg> it was fun
17:22 <@gbjk> lol @ you too
17:22 <@gbjk> s/too/two/g
17:22 <@Elthek> sphyg: It's a presentation on my third-year project, to the Inference group, CS and Microsoft Research.
17:22 <@Elthek> But it's okay, because I'm not REALLY FUCKING NERVOUS or anything.
17:22 <@Greg> Elthek: really? i'd be fucking nervous if i was you
17:22 <@Greg> and i mean really nervous
17:22 <@Elthek> Greg: Cunt.  :)
17:23 <@Greg> microsoft send really good people into these sorts of things
17:23 <@Greg> woooow weee id be nervous
17:23 <@sphyg> gbjk: when?
17:23 <@Elthek> Dude!
17:23 <@Greg> gosh i'm even nervous for you now and im not doing it ;-)
17:23 <@Greg> Sweet!
17:23 <@Elthek> No!  Not sweet!
17:23 <@Greg> No! Dude!
17:23 <@sphyg> elthek: coo, you're an academic
17:23 <@Greg> don't worry i've seen microsoft in action recently they tend to hide from me
17:24 <@gbjk> Greg: what did you do
17:24 <@Elthek> sphyg: Shush.  :)
17:24  * Greg just discused stuff with them and their network manager sort of ran away and didnt want to answer my questions
17:24 <@Greg> but its a long story
17:25 <@Elthek> Greg: Heh.  I can still feel adrenalin from that game.  :)
17:28  * hex wonders how someone from Brazil came to be on london-list
17:29  * Dom2 points out COALESCE to a sql seeking colleague
17:29  * sphyg goes shopping
17:29 <@Dom2> hex: the usual way.  flunked all the entrance exams.
17:30 <@marnameow> Ooh! Less than a week to Galstonbury. I think I cna start getting excited now.
17:30 <@Dom2> you're going?
17:30 <@Elthek> sphyg: Hey, are you going to the Tim O'Reilly talk on Monday night?
17:30 <@marnameow> Yup!
17:31 <@Dom2> wow, how did you manage to get tickets?
17:31 <@davorg> dipsy, going to glastonbury?
17:31 <+dipsy> davorg: bugger all, i dunno
17:31  * marnameow is going to the Tim O'Reilly talk. Sheep just booked us.

17:31 <@DrHyde> bwahahahahahaa
17:31  * Elthek isn't sure he'll be able to get back from Cambridge in time.
17:31 <@Dom2> DrHyde: Makes a change from seeing perl looking like that
17:31 <@sphyg> elthek: dunno yet
17:31 <@marnameow> Dom2: Was working from home the morning they came out. Put the phone on handsfree and waited.
17:31 <@Magnus> Elthek: you should invite him to dinner, like we did
17:31 <@Dom2> DrHyde: I'd also be more impressed if the memory was 64Mb. :)
17:32 <@Dom2> marnameow: well done, indeed!W
17:32 <@DrHyde> my perl processes max out at about 300Mb :-(
17:32 <@sphyg> magnus: huh?
17:32 <@marnameow> I bought three, and *so* wished that I'd got another one later.
17:32 <@Dom2> DrHyde: I wrote a script to test how fast memory leaks can build up
17:32 <@Dom2> DrHyde: It just created circular refs in a while loop
17:32 <@marnameow> There are too many people I know who don't have them.
17:32 <@Magnus> sphyg: Tim O'Reilly went to dinner with netcrafters on Wednesday
17:32 <@Magnus> and his mum
17:32 <@Dom2> DrHyde: That hit 1.5Gb in under 5 minutes :)
17:33 <@marnameow> Tom O'Reilly will get *fat* with all these dinners!
17:33 <@davorg> he had a huge cake last night
17:33 <@davorg> but he shared it with all of us :)
17:33 <@marnameow> Oh, Friday! That means.... I should make a poll!

17:38  * DrHyde puts on his "Databases Are My Bitch" hat
17:38 <@hex> Kake: congratulations. Who are the Flying Pickets?

17:40 <@davorg> he's a dick
17:40 <@Magnus> in fact I owe her an ice cream
17:40  * Greg carried liam neeson's fathers coffin
17:40 <@hex> davorg: but he has a comedy tongue

17:41 <@davorg> Magnus: wasn't she also in Time Gentlemen Please
17:41 <@Magnus> davorg: oh yeah, I haven't seen it thoug
17:41  * hex combs his celebrity-connection branex
17:41 <@hex> s/x/z/
17:41 <@Magnus> she was lovely at school
17:41 <@hex> my dad beat Richard Branson in a curry-eating contest once. 
17:41 <@Magnus> complete bitch last time I ran into her
17:41 <@Greg> and i got Mr Bronson (from Grange Hill and of course one of the Star Wars movies and one of the Indiana Jones movies) drunk
17:41 <@itz> I used to live on the same road as Queen's bass player
17:42 <@yaxu> blimey
17:42 <@hex> It's a veritable celebrity network!
17:42 <@itz> before he was famous
17:42 <@Dom2> Celeb::Hookup
17:42 <@yaxu> i saw will self walking through leicester square earlier
17:42 <@Greg> its seven degrees of pathetic celeb stories
17:42 <@hex> arrr
17:42 <@davorg> oh and I once crashed and burned whilst chatting up various members of Toto Coelo
17:42 <@yaxu> bjork once fell on me in a club
17:42  * hex saw Ginger Spice whilst going to the pub with muttley once
17:42 <@Greg> davorg: <aside> you are showing your age now </aside>
17:42 <@Magnus> Greg: how did you meet mr bronson?
17:43 <@davorg> :)
17:43 <@itz> a friend's brother once shared his bong with lemmy as well
17:43 <@Magnus> and who was he in Star Wars/Indiana Jones
17:43 <@davorg> melinda messenger stood on my toe
17:43 <@yaxu> i've met ashley pomeroy
17:43 <@hex> my dad used to play challenge games of Asteroids with Lemmy
17:43 <@Magnus> I was 5 feet away from Prince Harry on Sunday

17:43 <@Greg> in IJ he was hitler
17:43 <@hex> oh, and I met that Dave Gorman once
17:43 <@Greg> he has played hitler on a number of occasions
17:43 <@Magnus> hitler??? no way
17:44 <@Greg> hex: don't go down the comedy route, dave will win
17:44 <@Greg> Magnus: you know in the 3rd movie, where hitler signs the grail diary
17:44 <@Magnus> I didn't think much of Robert Llewellyn
17:44 <@hex> Greg: I've already exhausted my comedy list :)
17:44 <@Magnus> grumpy twat
17:44 <@Magnus> Greg: yes, I know
17:44 <@yaxu> i met one of the guys from press gang / grange hill
17:44 <@Greg> in star wars i cant remember who he was
17:44 <@hex> Magnus: I saw him in a shopping centre near my house last year
17:44 <@Greg> apparently he has played hitler 3 times
17:44 <@Magnus> I think he had his boyfriend accompanying him, and they both kept loudly talking about their wives and girlfriends
17:45  * davorg booked marillion before anyone had heard of them
17:45 <@hex> er... and when Mark Morrison got arrested for waving a gun around, that was in one of my local newsagents
17:45 <@yaxu> i met jem finer from the pogues too
17:45 <@Dom2> Robert Llewellyn is great
17:45 <@Greg> davorg:  that fact will make probably only one person envious on this channel, and its someone who already knows the fact
17:45 <@davorg> oh and i turned down culture club _because_ no-one had heard of them
17:45 <@itz> what about a "my brush with fame" wikki?
17:45 <@PerfDave> davorg: You're to blame for encouraging Marillion? ;)
17:45 <@davorg> PerfDave: well, a bit
17:46 <@PerfDave> davorg: Damn you!
17:46 <@Greg> davorg++ # encouraging marillion
17:46 <@yaxu> sean from autechre joined one of my mailing lists once
17:46 <@itz> is that the band who are like Genesis only worse?
17:46 <@davorg> see http://dave.org.uk/blog/archives/000008.html for my marillion story
17:46 <@PerfDave> (although on Marillion-related claims to fame, a mate of mine lives just down the road from Fish and plays with his synths. Fish now describes Marillion as "A bunch of pretentious middle-class wank" apparently.
17:46 <@davorg> itz: yeah
17:46 <@PerfDave> )
17:46 <@yaxu> itz: worse than genesis?
17:46 <@yaxu> ???
17:47 <@yaxu> i was talking to leafcutter john earlier, who's a bit famous
17:47 <@PerfDave> yaxu: Strange, scary, but true
17:47 <@Magnus> my friend flyerd eddie izzard at edinburgh festival
17:47 <@yaxu> we have a box full of every cd that phil collins ever released, including the genesis stuff
17:48 <@davorg> why?
17:48  * itz admits to recent genesis mp3 downloading
17:48 <@yaxu> were going to do their website but managed to get out of it
17:48 <@yaxu> itz--
17:48 <@yaxu> itz++ # honest
17:49  * davorg admits to recent genesis cd rippage
17:49 <@TeeJay> who could get a cheap .org.uk domain ?
17:49 <@itz> floyd are better of course
17:49  * TeeJay fancies setting up a FreeSoftwareForLibraries website
17:49 <@davorg> true
17:49 <@Greg> floyd are an entirely different band to genesis
17:49 <@TeeJay> to organise free software cdroms for local libraries
17:49 <@TeeJay> anyone else interested
17:50 <@marnameow> TeeJay: Would it mean talking to libraries? Cuz that's a bit eep.
17:50 <@davorg> scribot: http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20030619/wr_nm/religion_britain_witchcraft_dc_2 # Paganism on the rise. Buffy, Harry and Sabrina to blame
17:50 <@yaxu> the internet is a library
17:50 <@Greg> TeeJay: interesting idea, but im not sure libraries are a high enough profile now
17:50 <@marnameow> What sort of free software? Our libraries are Windoze-obsessed like everywhere else at work.
17:51 <@PerfDave> I watched about half abour of Blair Witch 2 the other night before the fucking fluffy Wiccan got too annoying
17:51 <@Greg> although the idea of teaming up with a PC manufacturer and supplying pc's with a cd burner and a stock of ISO's including gutenburg is very appealing
17:51 <@TeeJay> Greg: indeed
17:51 <@TeeJay> marna: openoffice, apache, gimp, etc
17:51 <@Greg> libraries++
17:51 <@TeeJay> could put together a few pundles
17:51 <@TeeJay> like graphics, web dev, games, etc
17:52 <@Greg> TeeJay: is it not cheaper just to sell the preburned CD's at libraries
17:52 <@TeeJay> and CPAN / debian mirrors on CDROM
17:52 <@itz> libraries++ // unjustly and ironically overlooked in the new Information Age
17:52 <@TeeJay> why not loan them out - a few copies of each
17:52 <@Greg> start with your local library
17:52 <@TeeJay> Greg: plan to
17:52 <@marnameow> TeeJay: IME they won't actually be able to use them. Because all the puters are controlled by the evil it folks.
17:52 <@Greg> just turn up one day and say i'd like you to sell these 50 CD's for me
17:52 <@Kake> A lot of libraries charge for CD loan anyway, so almost may as well sell them.
17:52 <@marnameow> Or are you wanting to give them out to people?
17:53 <@Greg> i dont care who gets the cash
17:53 <@TeeJay> whichever
17:53 <@Greg> but its all free stuff
17:53 <@TeeJay> goak is to ensure its available
17:53 <@Kake> It is a nice idea though, go for it.
17:53 <@itz> is it worth selling CDs they are practically zerocost
17:53 <@Greg> free operating systems, free software and free books
17:53 <@TeeJay> yup
17:53 <@TeeJay> free documentation, etc
17:53 <@Kake> You might want to supply some printed very basic docs with them.
17:53 <@Greg> itz: but they are not 0 cost exactly
17:53 <@TeeJay> giving away would cost too much - giving each library a few copies of each CD would be affordable
17:54 <@TeeJay> how they charged would be irrelevent as long as they were available
17:54 <@Magnus> TeeJay: it's a good idea
17:54 <@itz> greg: probably cost more to collect the revenue than the actual revenue itself
17:54 <@Kake> Start with your local library, keep notes of what works and what doesn't, pop it on a website with some success stories, publicise it.
17:54 <@Magnus> TeeJay: you could get a grant from the lottery to do that with
17:55 <@TeeJay> Magnus: indeed
17:55 <@Greg> TeeJay: why not remove the whole library thing and start a network marketting campaign as follows, you the seed say to someone would you like a CD (or CD set of $foo), you can either have it for free if you promise to duplicate it twice and offer it under the same terms as i am offering to you, or you can pay me me $foo which is just the cost of burning the CD's
17:55 <@TeeJay> if we did it for several libraries at the same time we could get in the paper and put together a website for others to follow suit
17:55  * TeeJay uses libraries
17:56 <@marnameow> Libraries keep wanting their books back. I don't like that.
17:56 <@Greg> me too
17:56  * marnameow seems to run a library instead.
17:56 <@Greg> but when i was a kid i couldnt afford to buy enough books
17:56 <@itz> keep renewing
17:56 <@Greg> libraries are very special places
17:56 <@Greg> very very special
17:57 <@itz> the Victorians did libraries best
17:57 <@marnameow> I read everything in the library when I wa small.
17:58 <@marnameow> I didn't read right through the grown up library because there was so much trash that even I couldn't read.
17:59 <@Magnus> I just stuck to the classics
17:59 <@Magnus> Adams, Pratchett
17:59 <@Magnus> Peter David
18:00  * davorg read nothing but sci-fi when he was young
18:00 <@davorg> i got better
18:01 <@itz> Danny Dunn
18:01 <@marnameow> I read almost everythng I could get my little paws on.
18:01  * yaxu has booked train tickets to glasto
18:01 <@PerfDave> I grew up on Alan Garner and Isaac Asimov, mostly
18:01  * yaxu gets EXCITED
18:01  * TeeJay grew up on Asimov
18:01 <@davorg> i grew up on asimov. but he moved so i fell off.
18:02 <@davorg> looking back, i can't believe i read so much asimov
18:02 <@davorg> what was i thinking?
18:02 <+pasty> "hex" at 217.10.129.148 pasted Truly bad pun I just read at http://paste.husk.org/42
18:03  * yaxu read very little, considering that he grew up living above his dad's bookshop
18:03  * yaxu spent his time in the office on the computer instead
18:03 <@marnameow> You lived above a *bookshop*? Wow! That would have been marna-heaven
18:03 <@Magnus> hex: truly bad
18:03 <@itz> Heinlein++
18:04 <@yaxu> marnameow: yep, worked in it on saturdays
18:04 <@muttley> seen mbm
18:04 <+dipsy> mbm was last seen on #london.pm 14 days, 21 hours, 39 minutes and 50 seconds ago, saying: right, see people in the pub [Thu Jun  5 18:22:08 2003]
18:04 <@davorg> heinlein is a lot better than asimov
18:04 <@yaxu> marnameow: working in a bookshop isn't quite as idyllic as it might sound though
18:04 <@davorg> his politics were a bit dodgy tho
18:04 <@hex> muttley: my god! he never came back!
18:04 <@aef> Magnus: Yeah, have you seen Black Books? :)
18:04 <@Magnus> no
18:04 <@muttley> hex: lol
18:04 <@marnameow> yaxu: But the books, the books! The reading of the books! 
18:04 <@Magnus> need to
18:05 <@yaxu> marnameow: i didn't really get into books past my asterix and tintin phase until i read 1984 for gcse english
18:05 <@itz> that Moorcock is a bit of a leftie isn't he? :)
18:05 <@marnameow> I really wanted to work in a bookshop when I was younger. This is back when I had shitty jobs places like Burger King.
18:05 <@davorg> itz: he can be :)
18:05 <@yaxu> marnameow: you don't have time to read, though
18:05 <@marnameow> But I spent almost all of my childhood reading.
18:05 <@marnameow> You don;t have time to read in Burger King, either.
18:06 <@yaxu> marnameow: lots of ordering and stock managing and ringing customers and serving etc
18:06 <@marnameow> But at least you get to snuggle the books in a bookshop.
18:07 <@hex> "Could you sign this for me?" "Sure." "...What did you write?" "You should be in jail."
18:07 <@davorg> hmmm... book snuggling considered a bit strange :)
18:08 <@marnameow> Book strokeage also strange?
18:08 <@davorg> almost certainly
18:09 <@marnameow> Book hugging?
18:09 <@davorg> books are for readin'
18:09 <@marnameow> And lovin' - you got to give the books some lovin' too.
18:09 <@davorg> maybe. where lovin' == giving them a nice bookcase to live in
18:10 <@marnameow> Once, when I was moving house, I poured all my books into a pile on the floor and rolled around in it before putting the books on shelves.
18:10 <@marnameow> I think you'll consider that odd too.
18:10 <@davorg> just possibly
18:10 <@itz> hard or paperbacks?
18:10 <@davorg> :)
18:10 <@marnameow> mostly paperbacks.

18:21 <@marnameow> I think I may be a kitten-meme carrier. 
18:21 <@TeeJay> Ranguard: yes
18:21 <@TeeJay> could also aim at schools
18:21 <@PerfDave> itz: The kitten meme seems to be locked into f*rrydom, which is itself a meme that should be stamped out

18:21 <@marnameow> My kitten-meme is fairly furry-free.
18:22 <@mbm> marnameow: how about a poi-meme
18:22 <@marnameow> Can you poi while drinking?
18:22 <@mbm> no, not yet
18:22 <@Greg> magnus: fs
18:22  * Magnus can
18:22 <@marnameow> mbm: You carry that. Not me.
18:22 <@PerfDave> poi. It's (allegedly) acceptable GBH.
18:22 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: is it just going to be software ?
18:22 <@Magnus> marnameow: if you like, I will demonstrate poi while drinking next weekend
18:22 <@Magnus> more like drinking while poi
18:22 <@TeeJay> Ranguard: no
18:22 <@mbm> Magnus: scary
18:23 <@marnameow> You have to find me first, though.
18:23 <@TeeJay> not just software but mostly software
18:23 <@Magnus> marnameow: I will use my spidey-sense
18:23 <@chrisa> mbm: there so *is* a poi-meme already
18:23 <@TeeJay> software4all is available
18:23 <@Magnus> poi?
18:23 <+dipsy> somebody said poi was an art of twirling that was performed by Maori women in order to keep themselves supple and agile. The moves used by firechains have many similarities to those of poi, apart from the fact that the balls used in traditional poi were not lit or at http://www.homeofpoi.com/ or plural and singular like sheep or waving balls on string around like a hippy nonce or as pointless as juggling
18:23 <@TeeJay> softwareanddocumentation4all is a bit long :)
18:23 <@marnameow> Ooh bugger. I wanted to make a big purple sparkley kitten for glasto.
18:23 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: lets think about it over the weekend :)
18:23 <@Magnus> marnameow: I promise not to try and fastseduce you
18:23  * Magnus is making many t-shirts
18:23 <@TeeJay> Ranguard: can you set up software4all.cuckoo.org ?
18:23 <@marnameow> You'll not fast-seduce me! 
18:24 <@adam> Magnus: I can't imagine it works if you warn people.
18:24 <@TeeJay> until we decide and buy a domain ?
18:24 <@marnameow> It wouldn't work.
18:24 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: sure, 2 mins
18:24 <@chrisa> Magnus: can you make an 'uck Po' please?
18:24 <@TeeJay> cool :)
18:24 <@TeeJay> Ranguard++
18:24 <@marnameow> Magnus: What will your tshirts day?
18:24 <@marnameow> say, even....
18:24 <@Magnus> chrisa: ?
18:24 <@chrisa> as in 'uck Wa'
18:24 <@mbm> chrisa: well, of course.
18:24 <@Magnus> marnameow: I'm making one that just says 'MAGNUS' in huge letters across my tits
18:25 <@Magnus> I am making three that say 'You can have this t-shirt... if you give me a snog'
18:25 <@marnameow> In case you forget who you are, or in case other people do?
18:25 <@Magnus> and on the back it will say 'no mingers'
18:25 <@Magnus> which I might make into a t-shirt all by itself
18:25 <@Magnus> I will probably bring my 'I've got SARS' t-shirt too
18:25 <@marnameow> What if bois want the snogging tshirt? Will you accept their snogs?
18:26 <@Magnus> of course not
18:26 <@Magnus> that would be silly
18:26 <@Kake> They will have to get someone who wants to snog them to snog Magnus and win the tshirt.
18:26  * lathos remembers that housemates are the root of all kinds of evil.
18:26 <@Magnus> actually maybe to be safe I will put "(girls only)" on the back
18:27 <@Magnus> although perhaps no mingers covers that
18:27 <@lathos> (Having just extricated a key, a lighter, and other bits and pieces from the washing machine.)
18:27 <@Magnus> other t-shirt "DON'T BOTHER - I have a really small penis"
18:27 <@marnameow> You should make a tshirt that says 'line up here for hot fastseductin' action'
18:27  * PerfDave wants a "No you're *not* a fucking kitten/elf/vampire/(delete as appropriate)" range of T-shirts
18:28 <@Elthek> PerfDave: Yes!
18:28 <@marnameow> PerfDave: With velcro, and you can change the hated thing as you meet people who are kittens or elfs or vampires.
18:28 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: http://software4all.cuckoo.org/ will be live when the DNS propogated
18:28 <@PerfDave> Can T-shirts have drop-down boxes? :)
18:29 <@marnameow> Could do a foldy-down cloth one?
18:29  * aef is a delete as appropriate! I am!
18:30 <@PerfDave> That reminds me, i need to work on the ticky box T-shirts for Whitby
18:30 <@marnameow> ticky box tshirt?
18:30 <@Kake> Ooh, Auf Wiedersehen Pet is on tonight.
18:30 <@Kake> I love that programme.
18:30  * Magnus tries hard to think of other t-shirt ideas
18:30 <@PerfDave> marnameow: Laminated T-shirt with a ticky box that you can tick with a felt tip and wipe clean and tick again for hours of ticky fun
18:33 <@marnameow> Magnus: I bought the sheep a tshirt that says 'Feminist chicks dig me'
18:33 <@Magnus> that's cool
18:33 <@Magnus> a lesbian I met on wednesday night had an 'easy on the meatballs' t-shirt
18:33 <@Magnus> with a picture of a fork, meatballs, with spaghetti dangling
18:33 <@Magnus> to give the suggestion of a penis
18:33 <@Magnus> I asked her if it meant she was a VAG-etarian
18:33 <@Magnus> and she kept saying no, she ate meat
18:34 <@marnameow> Did she hit you?
18:34 <@Magnus> no
18:34 <@Magnus> in fact she was fairly cuddly by the end of the night
18:34 <@Magnus> but she was stupid
18:35 <@hex> Hey, did you see this article in the paper? Apparently a psychic dwarf has gone on the run with money he stole from the circus. The headline says "Small Medium at Large"
18:35 <@marnameow> But you didn't seduct her?
18:35 <@marnameow> Did you try to seduct her?
18:35 <@Kake> Did you threaten to seduct her?
18:35 <@hex> 'seduct'?
18:35 <@Magnus> hush
18:36 <@PerfDave> hex: Never buy a retarded dwarf. It's not big and it's not clever.
18:36  * marnameow is going to make a 'seducterated' tshirt for Magnus to give his victims.

18:58 <@PerfDave> Best module for XML / RPC?
18:58 <@vorsprung> itz, the side of the righteous
18:58 <@hex> vorsprung: good answer.
18:58 <@Magnus> and then there's the whole thing how Judas actually did Jesus the biggest favour ever
18:59 <@Magnus> or how God must have intended for humans to fall, otherwise he'd be fallible
18:59 <@vorsprung> seeing as larry trained as a missionary and pumps vast amounts of cash into a church I think we can guess where he stands on the religion question
18:59 <@Magnus> and then when that fails you can just point out the weaknesses in their personalities that lead to them being christians
18:59 <@PerfDave> I don't have a problem with Christians, provided they don't try to convert me. I have more of a problem with church organisations.
19:00 <@itz> wasn't Judas told to go to the Romans by Jesus anyway?
19:00 <@Magnus> itz: well quite
19:00 <@lathos> itz: Um. No.
19:00 <@Magnus> yeah I'm sure he was
19:00 <@itz> one of the Gospels gives that impression
19:01 <@lathos> Cite?
19:01 <@Magnus> probably one of the dead sea scrolls
19:01 <@itz> gimme a min
19:01 <@lathos> You're probably thinking of "What you have to do, do quickly."

19:02 <@aef> Surely larry would be a _bless'ed_ ref? :)
19:02 <@itz> yoda: yes its good
19:03 <@PerfDave> hex: To be fair, when somebody like that talks to me, I can feel my life force draining away...
19:03 <@lathos> itz: John 13:27, And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly
19:03 <@yoda> itz: any idea why "alt-left arrow" isn't working on my system?
19:03 <@PerfDave> lathos: Is that support for the rhythm method? ;)
19:04 <@lathos> This is me not going that way.
19:04 <@itz> lathos: yes thats the one

19:05 <@hex> lathos: I'd want to do it quickly if Satan entered into me.
19:06 <@itz> lathos: the whole of John 12:21-30 sounds like a leader telling a follower to betray him
19:06 <@aef> But if Jesus, God and Holy Ghost are one, and Satan entered into Jesus...
19:06 <@lathos> aef: Good try.
19:06 <@itz> rather than prediction
19:07 <@lathos> itz: I'm not sure how you get to that. Do you mean ch.12?
19:07 <@itz> yes
19:07 <@vorsprung> itz, judas was in charge of the cash.  That remark could have ment anything
19:07 <@hex> lathos: I take it you're a Trinitarian then
19:07 <@Magnus> I thought that ITV 'Second Coming' thing was pretty good
19:07 <@lathos> itz: I don't follow, then.
19:07 <@lathos> hex: Huh?
19:07 <@itz> someone in charge of the cash is the most trusted follower
19:08 <@itz> its usually held to be prediction but it reads more like instruction I think
19:08 <@vorsprung> hex, do you mean
19:08 <@Magnus> itz: could be a translation thing
19:09 <@vorsprung> hex, Trinitarian == accepts the notion of father, son and holy ghost
19:09 <@hex> vorsprung: yes, exactly
19:09 <@itz> magnus: sure you can read virtually any meaning into it 
19:09 <@lathos> itz: John 12:21-30 reads like "It's all about to go really bad."
19:09 <@vorsprung> hex, most christians do it's a conventional point of view
19:09 <@lathos> hex: Yes, then.
19:09 <@vorsprung> hex, I don't think I've met one that didn't in fact
19:09  * hex nods
19:10 <@hex> vorsprung: there aren't many of us Unitarians
19:10 <@itz> lathos: thats what I meant by "prediction" above
19:10 <@hex> technically speaking I'm a Unitarian Universalist, but I share some of the approach of Islam to their prophets.
19:10 <@lathos> itz: Yes. How do you get from there to "instruction"?

19:14 <@vorsprung> PerfDave, it came from inside *your* mouth :)
19:14 <@vorsprung> hex, nope
19:14 <@itz> lathos: if you read the text and take the most obvious simple  interpretation of words and events   rather than the one everyone has been taught
19:15 <@hex> lathos: that's a good page; thank you.
19:15 <@lathos> itz: I'm reading the text, and the text says "I'm not going to say 'save me from this hour', because it's for this hour that I've come". If you're reading that as an instruction instead of a prophecy, we're probably too far apart to reason.
19:16 <@vorsprung> jouke, are you going for a job at sift?
19:16 <@hex> Interesting: "King John Sigismund of Transylvania (now a part of Romania and Hungary) in 1568 issued the first edict of religious freedom. This allowed citizens to hold diverse religious beliefs and still be loyal to the state."
19:16 <@hex> Hoorah for King John!
19:16 <@vorsprung> statist
19:17 <@aef> The mould's probably thinking "Why is it only at the *end* of the afternoon that you notice that Perf's been drinking from your bottle all day?"
19:17 <@hex> If it's a good state, you should be loyal to it. Unfortunately, the number of good states are few and far between.
19:17 <@hex> But that's beyond the scope of this conversation.

19:20 <@lathos> Ah, good. I'm glad I asked the first time if you meant that chapter. :)
19:21 <@lathos> I suppose "This is going to happen. Let's get it over quickly." could be thought of as an instruction *as well*.
19:21 <@aef> In the beginning there was the word, and the word was LILO: ?
