20:00 < MaliXeanz> hmmm... oh
20:00 < muskie> then gave up and reinstalled mandrake 9
20:00 < MaliXeanz> man, I should read instructions first x)
20:00 < LethalWP> just press f when you're in a game
20:00 < MaliXeanz> gotcha
20:00 < muskie> now..
20:00 < LethalWP> muskie: ! i use rh linux, i'm very happy with it
20:00 < muskie> did endy tag it?
20:00 < muskie> meh
20:00 < LethalWP> more happy than my debian
20:01 < MaliXeanz> LethalWP: f button doesnt do anything =/
20:01 < Yohein> well

20:01 < muskie> urpmi is a lot easier to type than apt-get
20:01 < MaliXeanz> lea: it doesnt go fullscreen, yes
20:01 < LethalWP> f5
20:01 < muskie> that's the only reason I use mandrake. XD

20:02 < MaliXeanz> tnx a million
20:03 < timofonic> exist a scummvm game with 2 player support, o yes ?
20:03 < LethalWP> nope
20:04 < MaliXeanz> hey, what the... I tried to rise my music volume by pressing [ and the game window doubled its size
20:05 < smelialichu> <LethalWP> $ ldd scummvm |grep vorb << do you mean that scummvm does have ogg support by default?
20:06 -!- dv [~lyc@terrato.org] has left #scummvm ["Drive defensively; buy a tank."]
20:06 < muskie> who the heck are these people?!
20:07 < LethalWP> no i mean: check your compiled binary, maybe it was compiled with, if it needs that lib, it's in
20:07 < LethalWP> if it doesn't, it's nt
20:07 < LethalWP> o
20:07 < smelialichu> how do I check if it has it compiled?
20:07 < smelialichu> executing that command tells me no such file or directory
20:08 < smelialichu> libvorbisfile.so.3 => /usr/lib/libvorbisfile.so.3 (0x400ef000)
20:08 < smelialichu>         libvorbis.so.0 => /usr/lib/libvorbis.so.0 (0x400f6000)
20:08 < smelialichu> ok, I cd'ed to /usr/bin
20:08 < smelialichu> so I do have vorbis support
20:08 < LethalWP> it seems to be compiled in yupz
20:09 < smelialichu> but no mp3?
20:09 < smelialichu> legal reasons?
20:09 < LethalWP> ask the guy who compiled it
20:09 < LethalWP> or he didn't read the Makefile before compiling
20:09 < smelialichu> well I got the official release
20:09 < smelialichu> in binary rpm form
20:10 <@olki> you're talking about redhat rpms?
20:10 <@olki> ah
20:10 <@olki> yep
20:10 <@olki> wjp didn't compile with mp3
20:10 < smelialichu> oh yeah
20:10 < muskie> yo guys?
20:10 < smelialichu> red hat can't play back mp3's
20:10 <@olki> since mp3 libraries aren't included in redhat anyway
20:10 < smelialichu> unless you install the libraries
20:10 < LethalWP> smelialichu: it can, with the required soft installed
20:10 < muskie> Would anyone mind burning me a copy of Mandrake 9.1?
20:10 < smelialichu> but all the other builds are fine with mp3 then I guess?
20:11 < muskie> I'm not upgrading over a 56k modem here. :P
20:11 < smelialichu> LethalWP: that's what I meant :)
20:11 < LethalWP> muskie: do you come at home to get it?
20:11 < smelialichu> muskie: by a magazine with it on
20:11 < smelialichu> I got it on a DVD on the front of Linux Format
20:11 < LethalWP> muskie: it'll be faster for you to d/l it, than me sending you the cds (a letter from .be to .au takes 1 week)
20:11 <@olki> smelialichu: then just compile scummvm yourself...
20:11 < timofonic> mandrake sux
20:11 < LethalWP> timofonic: you can't use it
20:12 < muskie> ahem. 9.1. :P i got mandrake 9.0 off a CD in the first place. :P
20:12 < smelialichu> olki: sure, I was just asking if windows/dc ports etc have mp3 support by default
20:12 < timofonic> LethalWP: cant use it ? why ? exist mandrake PPC
20:12 < smelialichu> it's just not the rpm because red hat doens't include mp3 libraries?
20:12 <@olki> no idea. you would have to ask the respective porters
20:12 < smelialichu> timofonic: I like mandrake
20:12 < smelialichu> k
20:12 < timofonic> LethalWP: i prefer debian, slackware
20:12 < timofonic> smelialichu: i hate mandrake
20:12 < LethalWP> i prefer redhat over debian
20:12 < smelialichu> timofonic: why do you hate mandrake?
20:12 < LethalWP> & haven't played a lot with mandrake
20:13 < timofonic> smelialichu: redhat 5.2 was good
20:13 < timofonic> but newer versions not
20:13 < LethalWP> smelialichu: like we care about redhat's decision
20:13 < LethalWP> first thing i do when i install rh is getting xmms reading mp3s
20:13 < LethalWP> =)
20:13 < smelialichu> so how would I compress the .sou?
20:14 < LethalWP> rtfm
20:14 < timofonic> smelialichu: with the tools... read...

20:54 < smelialichu> which Scumm games is it possible to die in?
20:55 < LethalWP> indy 3
20:55 < LethalWP> i thin kyou can get stuck in zak & maniac mansion
20:55 < smelialichu> darn, I hate getting stuck or dieing :/
20:55 < LethalWP> that's all i think
20:55 < LethalWP> or from what i know
20:55 < smelialichu> you can't die on indy 4?
20:55 < Lightkey> heh, are there adventures where you can't die?
20:55 < smelialichu> yes
20:56 < smelialichu> Monkey Island
20:56 <@joostp> I think you can die in indy4 too
20:56 < LethalWP> Lightkey: most of lucasarts game
20:56 < LethalWP> nope
20:56 < LethalWP> there are different endings
20:56 < LethalWP> one where you die
20:56 < LethalWP> but still, it's the end of the game
20:56 < Lightkey> yeah, where you die for example ;)
20:56 < smelialichu> Sam and Max, etc tons of lucasarts where you can't die
20:56 <@Jamieson630> Maniac Mansion lets you die left and right (a la Sierra Games), and Indy4 does allow you to die but makes it really obvious that the choice that gets you killed is a really stupid choice.
20:56 <@olki> you can die when you lose a fight in indy4
20:56 < LethalWP> there is no fight in indy4?
20:56 < smelialichu> dieing in the ending is different
20:56 < LethalWP> yeah one at the start, but that doesn't count
20:56 <@olki> and you can die in monkey1 if you stay longer than 10 minutes under water
20:57 < LethalWP> olki: oh 10 mins =) it didn't take me that much time to find the stupid/funny trick;)

20:57 < smelialichu> I never bothered trying :)

21:50 < falso> everyone loves discoworld
21:50 < smelialichu> was Discworld 2 written with a scripting language?
21:50 <@joostp> Bullshit. I'm sure someone, somewhere has the source.

21:50 < falso> joostp,  yes maybe

21:50 < MadMoose> it's down to the nitty-gritty business of RE then
21:50 < smelialichu> joostp: but legally it's probably ambiguous who has the right to let us use it
21:50 < falso> smelialichu,  discworld 1 is the best one
21:50 < LavosSpawn64> well, then go find someone with good IDA knowledge and way too much time on his hands. :)
21:50 < falso> lavosspawn64,  im learning c
21:51 <@joostp> falso: I dunno, people who worked on it...but with a reply like this, I doubt they want to give it out..
21:51 < falso> lavosspawn64,  if i can help ill try
21:51 < WooShell> otoh, where no owners are left, there is little risk of anyone complaining...
21:51 < LavosSpawn64> learning C is a good place to start with, but it'll take years until you're up to that level.
21:51 < falso> joostp,  i had other mails with him
21:51 < smelialichu> that's not the point
21:51 < LavosSpawn64> WooShell: Good point. ;)
21:51 < LavosSpawn64> it's not?
21:52 < falso> check here the last one joostp 
21:52 < falso> Hi Pedro,
21:52 < falso> It's nice to see the great work you're doing with Scumm games, and I agree
21:52 < falso> that Discworld would be a good game to port over. Unfortunately, I don't
21:52 < falso> have the source code (or for that matter the rights). Perfect Entertainment
21:52 < falso> went under some years back and nobody knows where the original source code
21:52 < falso> is today. Sorry about that, but I do wish you luck in porting other games
21:52 < falso> over.
21:52 < falso> All the best
21:52 < falso> Gregg Barnett
21:52 < smelialichu> if we are given source code by a developer who doesn't have the right to give it out, we don't have the right to use and could be forced to tear out the discworld part of the scummvm engine (when written)
21:52 < falso> :(
21:52 < LavosSpawn64> Yes, if there was someone with an interest in forcing us
21:53 < LavosSpawn64> If there's noone holding the copyright, I can't imagine who it could be
21:53 <@joostp> falso: I remember that mail. Didn't show much initiative from him as well, even though he says he would like to see it ported.
21:53 < smelialichu> LavosSpawn64: but someone will own the copyright, even if it is not clear who it is
21:53 < falso> if the code is lost forever
21:53 -!- |Cable| [~roxx@cm137105.red.mundo-r.com] has joined #scummvm
21:53 < falso> its really a bad thing
21:54 < falso> cause discworld is really a good game
21:54 < smelialichu> if a company goes under, the source code doesn't suddenly become public domain
21:54 < falso> that shouldnt be forgotten
21:54 < falso> :|
21:54 < LavosSpawn64> I think the probability is pretty low, though.
21:54 < LavosSpawn64> quite close to zero.
21:54 <@joostp> falso: yes, well there is always reverse engineering.. :|
21:54 < falso> joostp,  that should be very hard
21:54 < LavosSpawn64> smelialichu: And I don't even think we could be forced to remove it.
21:54 < falso> joostp,  did you guys did simon the sorcerer that way?
21:55 < smelialichu> LavosSpawn64: maybe not, but it's a battle we may be forced to fight
21:55 < LavosSpawn64> smelialichu: Even though of course it depends on your country's law. But in germany, I don't think they could.
21:55 < smelialichu> does the scummvm project want legal troubles?
21:55 < smelialichu> http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/05/1920207&mode=nested&tid=126&tid=163&tid=185
21:55 < MadMoose> LavosSpawn64: unless Terry Pratchett disagrees, of course...
21:55 < smelialichu> that is a recent ask slashdot post about who owns the source code when a company folds
21:56 <@joostp> falso: Simon was also RE'd, yes.  as far as I know..adventure soft is not too happy with scummvm support for simon games, but they haven't taken (legal) action
21:56 <@olki> they're not happy, no
21:56 < falso> joostp,  they still seel the game
21:56 < falso> sell
21:57 <@joostp> falso: that's besides the point..do you think scummvm support for those games will damage sales?
21:57 < falso> like.. it makes the games be more warezed
21:57 < falso> but...
21:58 < falso> those games have been warezed some years ago
21:58 <@joostp> maybe more warez, yes, but also more bought.
21:58 <@joostp> that sounded crappy, but you get the point.
21:59 < falso> yes
21:59 < falso> :)
22:00 < smelialichu> I don't see why they shouldn't be happy
22:00 < smelialichu> it allows more people to play the games
22:00 < smelialichu> now that means more sales
22:00 < smelialichu> and yes, I guess more people looking for pirated copies too
22:01 < falso> i jsust have a original game
22:01 < falso> that scumm supports
22:01 < MadMoose> It's not like it's gonna drive their sales any lower
22:01 < falso> indiana jones and teh fate of atlantis
22:01 < falso> the other ones i've downloaded them from the net
22:01 < falso> cause i love those games
22:02 < falso> and its not possible to get them anywhere now
