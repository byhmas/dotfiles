22:26 <edward> no
22:26 <edward> sorry, i was distracted for a bit
22:28 <hendry> Have you signed my key and stuff?
22:30 <edward> not sure
22:31 <hendry> wtf do I do when someone signs my key again
22:32 <edward> they should send you a file, feed it to gpg
22:32 <edward> gpg signedkey.pgp
22:33 <edward> hang on, no that is wrong
22:34 <edward> gpg --imporg signedkey.pgp
22:34 <edward> or they might just upload the key to the keyservers
22:34 <edward> in wich case you need to do
22:34 <edward> gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-key yourkeyid
22:35 <edward> or whatever keyserver
22:38 <hendry> Is that keyring only for DD?
22:41 <hendry> Some dewd sent me an inline -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
22:41 <hendry> any ideas how I handle that in mutt ?
22:42 <edward> save the mail to a file
22:42 <edward> C should save it
22:43 <edward> feed it to mutt
22:43 <edward> s/mutt/gpg/
22:45 <hendry> is there a way to nicely see who has signed my key. And who I haven't or vice versa oh god...
22:47 <edward> gpg --list-sigs keyid
22:48 <hendry> oh yes. I have yours.
22:48 <hendry> sig 3?
22:48 <hendry> sig 2
22:48 <edward> how much people trust you
22:48 <hendry> 3 is alot? or crap?
22:48 <edward> can't remember
22:51 <hendry> what about my sigs on others (?)
22:52 <edward> not easy to find
22:53 <hendry> any news? been upto anything interesting?
22:53 <hendry> do you have a blog or something?
22:55 <edward> http://www.evilgeniuses.org.uk/~edward/
22:55 <edward> it is not very up to date
22:55 <edward> are you on frienster.com?
22:55 <edward> friendster.com even
22:56 <hendry> fakester? :)
22:56 <edward> you not a fan?
22:56 <hendry> maybe I will sign up
22:56 <hendry> will you be my friend?
22:56 <edward> sure
22:56 <edward> edward@debian.org
22:56 <hendry> heard about it through an RDF/Semantic conference a collegue atteneded
22:57 <hendry> Serious Relationship?
22:57 <hendry> I want to meet HOT CHICKS
22:58 <hendry> Open Marriage??????+
22:59 <edward> where was the RDF conference?
22:59  * edward is interested in RDF
23:01 <hendry> why's that?
23:01  * edward thinks it is the future
23:02 <hendry> i've yet to see a decent app
23:02 <edward> it will spark the second tech boom
23:02 <hendry> ppl can't code html
23:02 <hendry> can we leave it up to them to lay down semantics?
23:02 <edward> if you knew HTML in 1996 you could earn a lot of money
23:02 <edward> you'll be able to earn lots if you can do RDF in 2003
23:02 <edward> actually more like 2005
23:03 <hendry> if you have cisco, novell, m$ quals you could earn more
23:03 <hendry> ;)
23:03 <hendry> 29,245 people in your Personal Network, through 1 friend.
23:03 <edward> the semantics is easy, i just pull data out of a database, and include the column headings
23:03 <hendry> WTFD
23:04 <hendry> that be true. but where is that done?
23:04 <edward> semantic web is not finished yet
23:07 <hendry> there by standards
23:07 <hendry> there be no decent imps
23:08 <edward> yep

23:21 <hendry> seems quite interesting
23:22 <hendry> feel a bit pathetic having just you as my one friend mind
23:24 <edward> get some other friends to join
23:24 <hendry> i've made a testimonial
23:28 <edward> i just read it
23:28 <edward> very helpful
23:30 <hendry> want me to lie?
23:30 <hendry> lol
23:31 <hendry> tell me what I should say
23:31  * edward can never think what to write
23:31 <edward> friendster is all a bit odd
23:32 <edward> but an interesting experiment
23:32  * edward thinks the newspapers will spot it and start writing about it, then there will be a lot more people on it
23:32 <edward> but it will crash, friendster have no business model and will not be able to pay for the database server and bandwidth
23:33 <hendry> didn't you see the VC stuff on theregister?
23:33 <edward> no
23:34 <hendry> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32965.html
23:36 <edward> interesting
23:39 <hendry> it is a little slow after a while of usage
23:40 <edward> yep
23:43 <hendry> are you on an IM network?
23:43 <edward> ICQ and AIM
23:44 <edward> last81 on AIM
23:44 <edward> 2077090 on ICQ
23:45 <hendry> isn't AIM/ICQ the same?
23:46 <edward> kind of
23:46 <edward> but i wanted to try iChat AV
23:47 <edward> which requires an AIM or .mac account
23:47 <edward> does not work with an ICQ account
