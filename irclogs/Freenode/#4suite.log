15:16 < hendry> I think I asked this question before but failed to take note. How do I check I have PyXML installed properly?
15:45 < Chimezie|ccf> import _xmlplus
15:46 < hendry> Chimezie|ccf: so once that is imported, I am using PyXML?
15:46 < Chimezie|ccf> if it imports with no tracebacks, I believe you can assume you've correctly installed pyxml
15:47 < hendry> and when I follow examples, like xml.sax it is using PyXML?
15:50 < Chimezie|ccf> I believe so.. I'm not as familiar w/ the inner workings of PyXML as uche/uo is
15:52 < uo> hello
15:52 < uo> xml.sax is part of Python as well as PyXML
15:53 < hendry> How do I tell them apart? :=
15:57 < uo> chime is right: look for _xmlplus
15:58 < uo> If you have an _xmlplus, you have PyXML
15:58 < hendry> So: import _xmlplus, xml.sax # Now I use PyXML
15:59 < hendry> import xml.sax # now I rely on python distro
15:59 < uo> try:
15:59 < uo>     import _xmlplus
15:59 < uo>     PYXML_INSTALLED = 1
16:00 < uo> except ImportError:
16:00 < uo>     PYXML_INSTALLED = 0
16:00 < uo> -----
16:02 < hendry> Ok, cheers
17:02 < hendry> xml.sax._exceptions.SAXParseException: /home/hendry/inex-1.4/xml/td/2002/l0142.xml:5:38: undefined entity
17:02 < hendry> I keep getting sax exceptions with certain xml. any tips?
17:08 < uo> Well, that looks like bad XML
17:08 < uo> Make sure yo define all your entities
17:13 < hendry> How do I define them? They sit here: /home/hendry/inex-1.4/dtd
17:13 < hendry> But how do I tell sax? As it not mentioned in the .xml files...
17:15 < hendry> And I can't edit the xml files.
17:29 < uo> That's a problem, because it's XMl non-compliant
17:29 < uo> If the XML files do not pont to the right DTD, then the XML file is not well formed
17:30 < uo> And there is nothing a compliant SAX appl can do about it
17:30 < uo> Can't you get your source to fix their XML?
17:30 < uo> They should be having the sme problem with any working tool
17:57 < hendry> uo: I am afraid I can't. XML is read-only and that's the way it stands. Must be a way around this mess...
18:13 < uo> That sucks
18:14 < uo> But the only way around it is finding/using an XML non-compliant tool
18:14 < uo> And that's really ugly, even if you find one
18:15 < uo> I don't know of nay parser that will allow you to fake out a DTD
18:15 < uo> Is there *any* DTD at all in the problem docs?
18:15 < uo> I mean DTDeclaration (DOCTYPE line)
18:15 < uo> If so, you might be able to use catalogs to redirect to a different DTD

17:08 < uche> But the one I suggest is to take advantage of XSLT's declarative prperties rather than fighting 'em
17:08 < uche> If you use a template *match* to acccess each class
17:08 < uche> Then you can easily use predicate on hat match to exclude cycles
17:09 < uche> i.e. no need to bother with a visited list
17:09 < Chimezie|ccf> by predicates you mean xpath predicates right??
17:09 < uche> yah
17:09 < uche> SOmething like:
17:11 < uche> rdfs:Class[not(//@rdf:resource = @rdf:about)]
17:11 < uche> Mind you, there are several problems:
17:11 < uche> 1) Performance
17:11 < uche> 2) Generality: you may also hav eto deal with rdf:ID
17:11 < Chimezie|ccf> oh well.. see
17:11 < uche> Can't you use Vrsa?
17:11 < Chimezie|ccf> the xslt wasn't transforming an RDF serialization
17:11 < uche> The combo of Versa and XSLT should be trump here
17:11 < Chimezie|ccf> i was planning on using versa
17:12 < uche> ah
17:12 < Chimezie|ccf> yeah
17:12 < uche> Even easier then :-)
