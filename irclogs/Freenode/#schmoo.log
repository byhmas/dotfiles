22:51 <@liiwi> there we go
22:51 < hendry> ah, this is what this is about :)
22:51 <@liiwi> hendry, squish moshez
22:52 <@liiwi> moshez, squish hendry
22:52 < _moshez> squish!
22:52 < hendry> _moshez: hi
22:52 < _moshez> hi
22:52 < _moshez> did you ask me about Lupy?
22:52 < _moshez> or something else?
22:52 < hendry> yes, I been trying to contact you about it
22:52 < hendry> lupy debian package
22:52 < hendry> Have you done one?
22:52 < _moshez> did you see it has a debian/ directory built in?
22:52 < _moshez> no, I haven't
22:53 < _moshez> it doesn't seem stable enough yet
22:53 < hendry> It has some problems. I use it :)
22:53 < hendry> what about debian dir?
22:53 < _moshez> yes. but that's the reason I decided not to polish up and upload
22:53 < _moshez> hendry: it should be good enough to build a package, modulo maybe adding a changelog entry
22:53 < _moshez> I wrote it :)
22:54 < hendry> I don't have a debian dir in my lupy disb. 
22:54 < _moshez> hrm
22:54 < _moshez> CVS should have one
22:54  * _moshez shrugs
22:54 < _moshez> I think....
22:55 < hendry> ok, new version... /me wgets
22:55 < _moshez> forget about versions, just check cvs
22:56 < hendry> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/lupy/
22:56 <@liiwi> so, anyone thinking about maintaining (uploading etc.) the package?
22:57 < hendry> something wrong with sf? or is it elsewhere?
22:57 <@liiwi> sf suck
22:57 <@liiwi> s
22:57 < _moshez> IIRC it's on tm.com
22:57 < _moshez> ask amiramir
22:57 <@liiwi> tm.com/users/amiramir/ ?
22:58 < _moshez> anyway, I'm not quite sure enough that it should get into debian
22:58 < _moshez> liiwi: amiramir is his username on fn
22:58 <@liiwi> how come?
22:58 < _moshez> well, the API still seems a bit prone to change
22:58 <@liiwi> ok, so it should be packages anyway
22:58 < _moshez> so packages depending on it would have to overspecify versioning depends or risk breakage
22:59  * _moshez shrugs
22:59 < _moshez> CVS should have my debian/ dir
22:59 < _moshez> I'm not sure what the release schedule for it looks like
22:59 < hendry> here my outdated packages : http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/debian/
22:59 < hendry> well, maybe i should find something else to package...
22:59 < _moshez> and what versions which version of Quotient needs
22:59 <@liiwi> heh
22:59 < _moshez> which is most important to me
23:00 < hendry> what is divmod? a twisted off shoot?
23:00 < _moshez> it's an application on top of Twisted
23:00 <@liiwi> nah, something grown on top of twisted
23:00 < _moshez> actually no it's not
23:00 < _moshez> divmod is a company
23:01 < _moshez> they develop something called Quotient
23:01 <@liiwi> get outta my head, you hyperactive thing
23:01 < _moshez> you meant to ask "what is quotient"
23:01 < _moshez> quotient is ready to be packaged yet either :)
23:01 < hendry> _moshez: anyway, if you can suggest something for to package or do debian wise I would be grateful
23:02 < _moshez> hendry: find something orphaned
23:02 < _moshez> hendry; wnpp :)
23:02 <@liiwi> yes, there's always wnpp
23:02 <@liiwi> actually
23:02 < _moshez> and also, d-i needs help, but that needs more Cish skills :(
23:03 <@liiwi> and plenty of programming-mojo
23:03 <@liiwi> hrm
23:03 < hendry> is that python->python2.3 thing sorted?
23:03 < hendry> I have not had a lot of time this month. Next month I can do stuff...
23:03 <@liiwi> I think it mostly needs nmus
23:04 <@liiwi> oh moshez
23:04 <@liiwi> http://kotisivu.mtv3.fi/gaeshido/galleria.htm
23:04 <@liiwi> in the first pic, observe Tv eating shoe
23:04 < hendry> Ok, well. I'm tired. Will get into the Debian thing again later
23:04 < hendry> _moshez: nice to finally chat to you
23:04 < _moshez> heh :)
23:05 -!- _moshez [~moshez@di3-99.dialin.huji.ac.il] has left #schmoo []
