11:08 < hendry> I have an xml file. I want to count how many <p> tags there are. And check they are not nested.
11:08 < hendry> I use sax? any methods to recommend?
11:17 < luciash> hendry: maybe <xsl:for-each select="//p"><xsl:if test="not('.//p')"><xsl:variable value="{count(.)}"/></.. ?
11:17 < luciash> hendry: just an idea, not tested
11:21 < hendry> xsl?
11:26 < luciash> hendry: yep
11:26 < luciash> brb

16:31 < Tycho> Hello.
16:49 < jor> hi
16:50 < shapr> y0
16:50 < jor> hey shapr, how's you xslt going today? :)
16:50 < shapr> I've been writing Haskell... wanna see the results? ;-)
16:51 < shapr> I wrote a factoid plugin for the Haskell irc 'bot
16:54 < jor> Is it better/smarter then the default factoid stuff most bots have nowadays? :)
16:54 < shapr> not yet
16:54 < shapr> I wrote it over the weekend
16:56 < shapr> if you have ideas or suggestions
16:57 < jor> write a english language/grammar plugin and make it pass the turing test ;p
16:57 < shapr> um
16:57 < shapr> I'm too little :-)
16:59 < jor> bleh, mozilla's xslt processor sucks
17:00 < jor> can't even output proper xhtml and show it as XHTML :/
17:02 < jor> and it's char encoding decisions suck also
17:02 < jor> now to get my hands on a box with IE6 :/
17:11 < Tycho> I know this is sort of off-topic, but I've been Googling for days and asking in bunches of channels with no resolve. I'm trying to find a library for PHP that allows XML validation against an XSD schema.
17:12 < Tycho> Library/function/anything
