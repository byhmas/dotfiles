17:46 < Conan> I've pasted in the mod_rewrite rules from - http://twistedmatrix.com/users/jh.twistd/moin/moin.cgi/HelpMiscellaneous?action=highlight&value=mod_rewrite - seems to working, except images. Whats does  the - do after /wiki/, shouldn't that be pointing to the htdocs part of moin?
17:52 < Conan> and why the "robots.txt"?
17:55 < Conan> anyway I've changed my rewrite rule to - RewriteRule ^/wiki/(.*)  /usr/share/moin/htdocs/$1         [last]
17:57 < Conan> and images work fine now, but I was wondering if there was a reason for a  the dash in RewriteRule ^/wiki/       -                      [last]
18:03 < ThomasWaldmann> hi
18:04 < Conan> hiya :)
18:04 < ThomasWaldmann> normally you have an alias /wiki/
18:04 < Conan> pasted in that stuff, changed it over to work in my setup.
18:04 < ThomasWaldmann> of course you also can use rewrite to do that
18:05 < Conan> yeah I've removed the alias and put in the mod_rewrite, I take it rewrite overrides aliases?
18:05 < Conan> so why the - in rewrite after /wiki/ rather than some real path?
18:05 < ThomasWaldmann> - means to do (change/rewrite) nothing
18:05 < Conan> ah, so that the alias works?
18:05 < ThomasWaldmann> yes
18:06 < Conan> gotcha, I'll just put that back in then, thanks
18:06 < ThomasWaldmann> and robots is for search engines
18:07 < Conan> dont have a robots.txt file,I'll do a little research on that.
18:07 < Conan> thanks
18:08 < ThomasWaldmann> np

18:20 < adlr> hi, is there a way to get moin moin to not show the globe icon nexxt to external links?
18:23 < ThomasWaldmann> afaik no
18:23 < ThomasWaldmann> except maybe if you simple write down the url only
18:23 < adlr> yeah.. or edit the python
18:23 < ThomasWaldmann> yes ;)
18:24 < ThomasWaldmann> but where's the problem with that?
18:25 < adlr> it's not a huge problem, just a minor detail
18:26 < Conan> on a wiki on the same lan, with a copy of the default site and a single page. I click on edit and it takes 13 seconds to appear?
18:28 < adlr> probably not, but no guarantees
18:33 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: thats a bit too long
18:40 -!- Omni|Sleep is now known as Omnifarious
19:03 < Conan> yeah thats what I was thinking,  the machine isn't doing anything either.
19:04 < Conan> any ideas how to debug it?

19:11 < Conan> and its a AMD 1800XP, with 512Mb of memory - currently doing nothing
19:12 < Conan> could it be mod_rewrite?
19:13 < Conan> yeah its defintely something up, an uncached page - ie "front page" just took 10 seconds.
19:17 < Conan> well its not mod_rewrite, just turned that off and editing a page is still slow to bring up :(

19:20 < waldi> Conan: you should compile the complete MoinMoin package
19:20 < Conan> compile?  thought this was python?
19:21 < waldi> yeah, it uses bytecode
19:21 < Conan> ok I'll give anything a try once :)
19:21 < Conan> is it easy to do?
19:21 < waldi> and if it lacks the ability to save and read the bytecode files it may uncredible slow
19:21 < waldi> yes
19:22 < Conan> ah I see what your saying, its compiling the code at runtime for each request?
19:22 < waldi> if it can't read or write the files, yes

19:50 < Conan> 496 or 500memory used
19:50 < Conan> so I'm guess its that, and lots of swap use
19:50 < Conan> trying to work on what app leakes
19:50 < Conan> leaked
19:51 < hendry> must I specify revert as an allowed action, or is on by default?
19:51 < ThomasWaldmann> hendry: using acls?
19:52 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: nevertheless it is strange that everything else works fast
19:53 < Conan> probably because they aren't going much with memory, i'm just restarting my machine - see if that makes a difference
19:54 < Conan> couldn't figure out where the memory leak was, ps -aux didn't show anything interesting
19:54 < hendry> ThomasWaldmann: moinmoin. what is acls?
19:56 < ThomasWaldmann> hendry: which version of moin?
19:57 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: no difference
19:57 < ThomasWaldmann> show_timings=1 in the config please
19:58 < Conan> damn was really hoping it would be that
19:59 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: you run current cvs?
19:59 < Conan> I think I got a snapshot
20:00 < Conan> show timings is on
20:01 < Conan> you want me to try CVS head again?
20:02 < hendry> ThomasWaldmann: stable. 1.0?
20:02 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: yes
20:02 < Conan> ok i'll dothat
20:02 < ThomasWaldmann> hendry: ah, ok. no, revert is on if you are logged in
20:03 < Conan> is nightly CVS tarball ok? or should I do a cvs checkout?
20:03 < Conan> ah I downloaded the Stable CVS tarball
20:04 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: nightly is ok, if you want easy updates you could also use cvs to checkout
20:04 < Conan> doing a CVS checkout anyway, easier
20:05 < ThomasWaldmann> you can then setup moin to run directly from workdir
20:05 < ThomasWaldmann> just remove the stuff from site-packages and add your workdir to moin.cgi
20:05 < Conan> I've deleted everything that was installed, easier
20:06 < ThomasWaldmann> <nop>SunOS . waaaaah, that twiki markup sucks.
20:09 < Conan> CVS head doesn't have a setup.py file?
20:10 < ThomasWaldmann> checkout "moin"
20:10 < Conan> ah I did MoinMoin :)
20:11 < Conan> whats the difference? MoinMoin cvs old or something?
20:12 < ThomasWaldmann> MoinMoin contains only the code, it is located under "moin"
20:18 < Conan> get this with cvs head  - http://www.rafb.net/efnet_cpp/paste/results/Zr781053.html
20:22 < ThomasWaldmann> [Sun Sep 21 18:24:01 2003] [error] [client 212.56.99.217] IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/error.log'
20:22 < ThomasWaldmann> either your data directory is misconfigured or no write rights
20:23 < Conan> oh yeah, I see it
20:24 < Conan> ok its up and running again
20:24 < Conan> whant me to put in that timings line?
20:25 < ThomasWaldmann> yes
20:25 < Conan> done
20:27 < ThomasWaldmann> still strange. on the edit page it tells me total=0.030 which seems rather a bit too fast than much to slow
20:28 < Conan> frontpage is still  fine too
20:28 < Conan> just gonna check memory usage, do you know a better command than ps -aux?
20:29 < Omnifarious> I like how MoinMoin uses the filesystem.
20:29 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: i dont think it is memory related, but you might try running top
20:29 < Omnifarious> I think it's important to start treating it as a bug that directories are typically implemented using very slow linear access data structures.
20:29 < Conan> memory used 248, total 503 meb. so loads of memory
20:30 < Conan> bloody hate top, cant figure out how to step and down the display list
20:30 < ThomasWaldmann> Conan: linux tries to use most of your memory. that isnt a bad, but a good thing.
20:34 < Omnifarious> Yeah, actually.  It tries to use all of your memory as a cache, if it can.

21:17 < Conan> http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/name-based.html
21:17 < Conan> info on *
21:20 < Conan> it is public, to the peeps I'm  working  with.
21:20 < Conan> anyway removed named virutal server, now have it to _default_:8081
21:20 < Conan> http://212.56.99.217:8081/ - still slow.
21:21 < Conan> with default I can test it with 192.168.1.7 and abot.
21:21 < Conan> 192.168.1.7 is lightening fast, but using the static ip address of my router is slow.
21:21 < Conan> could it be something to do with nat, and port redirection?
21:22 < ThomasWaldmann> maybe
21:22 < ThomasWaldmann> but the strange thing is that it only happens in that specific case
21:23 < Conan> yeah frontpage is fine, its gotta be something edit is doing thats causing this. something to do with edit/nat/portforwaring/external dns maybe?
21:26 < ThomasWaldmann> normally, dns is known for such "strange" delays.
21:27 < ThomasWaldmann> either by non-working lookups or non-working reverse lookups
21:29 < Conan> but if that was true, wouldn't frontpage be slow?
21:29 < ThomasWaldmann> yes, quite probably
21:38 < Conan> hm I'm completely lost now, on how to fix/debug this
21:39 < ThomasWaldmann> maybe try apache 1.3 ;)
21:39 < ThomasWaldmann> and don't use fancy things like * in vhosts
21:39 < Conan> can't, I'm using subversion
21:39 < Conan> i'm not using * at the moment
21:39 < Conan> just plain old _default_:8081
21:40 < ThomasWaldmann> shall i try from outside?
21:40 < Conan> sure
21:41 < Conan> http://212.56.99.217:8081/
21:43 < Conan> just got rid of the re-write too
21:43 < Conan> still slow :(
21:43 < Conan> http://212.56.99.217:8081/cgi/moin.cgi
21:44 < ThomasWaldmann> fast now
21:44 < Conan> edit is fast for you now?
21:45 < ThomasWaldmann> only on FrontPage 8( not on others
21:45 < Conan> still the same,
21:46 < Conan> gonna go back to my origial non vhost config, see if that makes a diff
21:53 < Conan> nope definitely nothing to do with virtual host. now having it running as a normal script alias :(
21:54 < Conan> all the pages are quick apart from boody edit.
21:54 < Conan> is edit doing anying with ip addresses?
21:55 < ThomasWaldmann> afaik no. the strange thing it that this does happen on action=edit (not on the POST when you save)
21:56 < ThomasWaldmann> so i dont see anything special there
21:57 < Conan> sorry dont understand that last statement? you saying that it doesn't happen when you save a page? only when you open it to edit it?
21:58 < Conan> I notice it sits on "waiting" for a while on the edit page
21:58 < Conan> hm wonder if I should put an ip monitoring on or something
22:00 < ThomasWaldmann> http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/SingletonWikiWordPlugin - what do you think of that?
22:00 < ThomasWaldmann> maybe run ethereal
22:01 < ThomasWaldmann> hmm, I'll have a look in the src, maybe I see sth there
22:03 < Conan> thats 212 is the static port address, so its direct to my router, which forwards direct to that machine.
22:03 < Conan> so it cant be DNS if its slow with that, we've ruled out virtual host
22:03 < ThomasWaldmann> with NAT that should be no problem
22:04 < Conan> slow : http://212.56.99.217/athicowiki/FrontPage?action=edit
22:04 < Conan> fast : http://192.168.1.7/athicowiki/FrontPage?action=edit
22:04 < ThomasWaldmann> VERY strange is that Frontpage is fast
22:05 < Conan> if 192.168.1.7 is fast. then its either the router or moinmoin.
22:05 < ThomasWaldmann> http://212.56.99.217/athicowiki/FrontPage?action=edit - fast from here (but i get a conflict warning)
22:05 < Conan> conflict?
22:05 < ThomasWaldmann> that sb else is/was editing the page
22:05 < Conan> yeah me :)
22:06 < ThomasWaldmann> maybe your router gets confused if you access the external ip from inside
22:06 < Conan> and adds 13 seconds?
22:06 < Conan> if that was the case wouldn't it do the same for frontpage?
22:07 < Conan> from a request point of view . isn't viewing frontpage the same as editing it?
22:07 < Conan> ie I make no more request on the ip address?
22:07 < Conan> both submit to a cgi, with variables, and then return the results - right?
22:08 < Conan> ah what about ip lock checking?
22:08 < Conan> ie how does it do locks?
22:12 < Conan> so when you request to edit a page, how does it check a lock?
22:13 < ThomasWaldmann>             version.revision, socket.gethostname(), request.clock.value('total'))
22:13 < ThomasWaldmann> that is happening after the "total" clock is stopped
22:14 < Conan> wonder if its  that socket.gethostname()
22:14 < Conan> what line and file is that in?
22:14 < ThomasWaldmann> please go to cgimain.py and comment out that 4 lines (ca. line 190-193)
22:16 < Conan> nope thats not it :(
22:16 < Conan> any other pages that doe socket work?
22:22 < Conan> probably the best thing I can do is print a lout of outs, showing  the time at different points
22:23 < Conan> whats the best way to do that in python?
22:23 < ThomasWaldmann> does spellchecking work?
22:23 < Conan> good place to start would be one at the beginning of moin.cgi and one at the end
22:24 < ThomasWaldmann> well, total is almost that
22:24 < Conan> yeah, thats slow too though
22:24 < ThomasWaldmann> also >10s?
22:24 < Conan> yeah
22:24 < ThomasWaldmann> fix it
22:24 < Conan> ???
22:26 < ThomasWaldmann> no, forget that.
22:26 < Conan> other action= stuff are ok too
22:27 < Conan> like info
22:27 < Conan> diff is fast
22:27 < Conan> you would think that diff would be slower than edit.
22:34 < Conan> interesting I commented out the lock line in PageEditor _init_ and the errors came back instantly
22:34 < Conan> that must atleast ean the pagerequest is instant
22:34 < Conan> its gotta be something to do with that lock
22:35 < ThomasWaldmann> looked at that already, but didnt find a place were it could hang for 10s
22:35 < ThomasWaldmann> and this would also get into "total"

20:36 < conan> Thomas: moin
20:36 < conan> :)
20:36 < conan> my blogger is comming along well
20:37 < conan> I started out using the MonthCalendar, using that to create entries. Then I made my own macro to display the last 5 entries
20:37 < ThomasWaldmann> hi conan
20:38 < ThomasWaldmann> ah, great ;)
20:38 < conan> then I reliased that I needed a way to navigate the 5 entries being shown. So I'm removing MonthCalander, replacing it instead with a javascript one I've almost finished
20:38 < ThomasWaldmann> I am working on doing a 1.1rc1 ;)
20:38 < conan> so now my 5 entries are displayed according to the value selelected in the javascript calender
20:38 < ThomasWaldmann> demo url?
20:38 < conan> to create a new entry, simply selected one of the 5 displays entries that haven't got a wiki page yet
20:39 < conan> gimme an hour or so and I'll show you
20:39 < ThomasWaldmann> ok
20:39 < conan> after that I still have one more  thing to do
20:39 < conan> you have the view that always shows X number of days from the set date. Which is fine for creating entries
20:40 < conan> problem is you want a "published" page that only shows entries with WikiPages. ie what happens is someone only enters something on mondays. the published page should only show entered values
20:40 < conan> I'll cross that bridge next
20:42 < conan> thomas: your client, is it windows or linux?
20:43 < ThomasWaldmann> linux
20:43 < conan> if its windows you gotta check out this new IRC client, its great - http://www.hydrairc.com/
20:43 < conan> ah ok, you'll have no use for hydrairc then
20:44 < ThomasWaldmann> my irc client runs on a remote server ;)
20:44 < conan> what IDE do you use for your python stuff?
20:44 < conan> UltraEdit doesn't really cut it for python stuff
20:48 < conan> python regexp seem more confusing than perls
20:49 < conan> whats ?P<offset> mean?
20:51 < ThomasWaldmann> ide -> mc and vim, sometimes ipython
20:51 < ThomasWaldmann> that's sort of a label/name for the following regex
20:52 < conan> guess I'll have to go away around read up on that
20:52 < conan> at the moment I'm just wining the python, from looking at the existing macros
20:52 < conan> s/wining/winging/
20:53 < conan> I saw the existing "blog" macro;s - but they were really very limited.

23:37 < DanielaNicklas> hi.
23:37 < Fabi> moin
23:38 < Fabi> revert is a relative new feature, that must be configured by the wiki admin
23:38 < Fabi> you must be logged in to be able to revert
23:40 < hendry> I am logged in
23:40 < hendry> Is revert in 1.0? or only 1.1?
23:40 < Fabi> 1.0 is quite old
23:40 < Fabi> I think it is only in the CVS
23:40 < hendry> Fabi: http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~tkt_esn/moin.cgi/FAQ?action=info
23:41 < hendry> I am hendry, and I want to revert back to my pages
23:41 < hendry> I am logged in
23:41 < hendry> but I don't have any revert option...
23:41 < hendry> So I need to install CVS stable ?
23:42 < Fabi> mompl
23:44 < Fabi> revert is in MoinMoin/wikiaction.py
23:44 < Fabi> you perhaps want to install a newer version
23:46 < Fabi> AFAIK the actual stable is a bit strange (didn't try myself)
23:47 < Fabi> the nightly build are stable
23:48 < DanielaNicklas> revert is in the 1.0 already
23:48 < hendry> Do I have to myself up as an Admin or something?
23:49 < hendry> Shouldn't I be seeing 'revert' in my actions menu?
23:49 < DanielaNicklas> Yes, you should. I'm just checking our config, if there is something special...
23:50 < hendry> DanielaNicklas: thanks...
23:51 < Fabi> No you can't see revert, because is is written with a lower are
23:52 < DanielaNicklas> We have DeletePage and AttachFile allowed.
23:52 < Fabi> it doesn't appear on the SystemInfo page either
23:52 < DanielaNicklas> You should see it in the "Action" row of the table of the info-Action.
23:55 < DanielaNicklas> Er, at info --> revision
23:55 < hendry> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/pictures/screenshot/2003-09-30-235339_1024x768_scrot.png
23:55 < DanielaNicklas> Yep, that's it. In 1.0, if you don't have "DeletePage" active, revert doesn't show up.
23:55 < DanielaNicklas> In 1.1, it does.
23:56 < hendry> I've just enabled DeletePage
23:57 < hendry> and nothing has changed in the view, besides 'There are 0 attachment(s) stored for this page.'
23:58 < hendry> I gather I should just install 1.1
--- Day changed Wed Oct 01 2003
00:00 < DanielaNicklas> Jep :) Now it disappeared in my local wiki, too.
00:00 < DanielaNicklas> (under 1.0)
00:01 < DanielaNicklas> With 1.1, its fine.
00:02 < hendry> Is it easy to upgrade I wonder?
00:02 < DanielaNicklas> Jep, but is is not proper documented.
00:03 < hendry> DanielaNicklas: Ok, I'll sleep now. Thanks for your help.
00:03 < DanielaNicklas> First of all, you should comment out the lines

21:43 < hendry> I am line 734 of wikiutil.py
21:46 < Fabi> sri I have an other MoinMoin version could you give me a line of code?

21:49 < hendry> I am trying to set the icon bar a class
21:49 < hendry> Also that links on the top to other pages
21:50 < hendry> so I can make a style sheet to display: none; them
21:50 < hendry> as it confuses some newbs
21:51 < hendry> MoinMoin 1.173
21:51 < hendry> is my version
21:57 < hendry> wikiutil
21:57 < hendry> evil bad HTML code

22:13 < ThomasWaldmann> moin
22:15 < Fabi> re
22:16 < Fabi> tw: we must start to increase the version number more often
22:17 < hendry> ThomasWaldmann: Hi
22:17 < hendry> I have just downloaded the CVS nightly
22:17 < hendry> Is it ok to work with that for a patch?
22:17 < ThomasWaldmann> do you mean release more often?
22:17 < ThomasWaldmann> hendry: yes
22:18 < ThomasWaldmann> what patch?
22:18 < hendry> ThomasWaldmann: would you think of accepting a hefty page which gets everything in XHTML
22:18 < hendry> and puts all style elements in style sheet
22:19 < ThomasWaldmann> that wont work
22:20 < hendry> why not? do you need to support NS4?
22:21 < ThomasWaldmann> no, but quite some people tried and there is not much if you have 95% xhtml compliance
22:22 < hendry> where did they fail?
22:23 < ThomasWaldmann> the line by line parser cant generate xhtml
22:25 < hendry> http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~tkt_esn/wiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage
22:26 < hendry> Ok, a short term goal is to get those icons and the links to the left in a class="something"
22:27 < ThomasWaldmann> you maybe should work on that, except if you want to do skinning/scheming stuff
22:27 < ThomasWaldmann> parts of that are already there
22:27 < hendry> I am not sure how to do that. Been staring at wikiutil line 737
22:28 < ThomasWaldmann> paste it here with some lines context
22:29 < Fabi> you cant do a lot within moin_config.py
22:29 < hendry> its too many lines
22:29 < Fabi> did you have a look at the drsrm skin as MoinMoin:SkinMarket
22:29 < wiki> -> http://twistedmatrix.com/users/jh.twistd/moin/moin.cgi/SkinMarket
22:29 < Fabi> just paste one
22:30 < ThomasWaldmann> hendry: the problem is that with scheming, all that html will have to be moved to the scheme
22:30 < ThomasWaldmann> so there is not much point in hacking the code for different html
22:31 < hendry> with XHTML code is much much nicer to maintain
22:32 < ThomasWaldmann> it will have to be removed there, so why change it before?
22:32 < hendry> can i turn off page tails and the icon toolbar for unlogged in users in moin_config ?
22:33 < Fabi> http://www.drsrm.de/drsrm/FrontPage (german)
22:34 < ThomasWaldmann> there is a global switch to turn of iconbar, but with some code you could base that on login
22:35 < hendry> is global switch something I can switch in the conf?
22:35 < ThomasWaldmann> yes
22:36 < hendry> does that go for the page trails too?
22:36 < ThomasWaldmann> only logged in users have trails
22:36 < hendry> so: page_icons = '0'
22:36 < hendry> lets see
22:36 < hendry> or 0 sorry
22:38 < hendry> Or None doh
22:41 -!- ppl [~ppl@mctn1-8068.nb.aliant.net] has joined #moin
22:50 < hendry> what should config.page_icons be set to, if you want it
22:52 < hendry> argh, need sleep &
22:53 < ThomasWaldmann> just grep the src or read the docs
