10:58 < gnufan> Ha, gui's, it has hid my text entry box below something else...
10:59 < gnufan> Hi Alex, Kai
11:01 < Chas> heyas
11:01 < hendry> lo
11:02  * hendry will idle here, need to get to work :)
12:40 < gnufan> What Java package you running on Debian Kai.... Simon, loading jdk.1.1 but thinking it sounds kind of old
12:41 < gnufan> unstable fixes the browser not talking very well bug - my browser now talks fine - lots of other things broke but while he is still talking he is probably conscious ;)
12:52 < hendry> gnufan: I despise Java and don't have it installed. :)

17:46 < gnufan> Hehe 1000000 files indeed...
17:47 < gnufan> I was quite surprised to see I have nearly 20's times as many files on my little Unix boxes as my big Oracle DB servers, but then I guess they have rather more 2GB files on them ;-)
18:12 < gnufan> Never mind how painful "ls" try "ls *" with a million files ;-)
18:15 < andew> it would certainly take a while 
18:42 < gnufan> Nah "ls *" will fail, at least in Bash, it expands the "*" to match files in the directory, and exceeds the allowable command length....
18:43 < gnufan> I've hit this in practice... most *nix systems only allow you 20,000 character command line... Solaris was 4MB last time I looked.
18:44 < gnufan> Why 4MB and not 2Gb or 4GB or maxXsiz where X matches one of the kernel parameters I've no idea.....
18:45 < gnufan> I'd kind of assumed Linux wouldn't have such a stupid restriction, but urm it seems it does.
18:52 < gnufan> ETA 6632 seconds - I need broadband so desparately it is sad :(
18:53 < andew> what are you downloading?
18:53 < gnufan> JRE for 1.4.1 from SUN comes in a 22MB tar ball.....
18:54 < gnufan> iiritatingly I can't find a Java package in Debian that will hack it, the app says Kaffe and IBM Jre don't hack it
18:54 < gnufan> Pity I have IBM JRE download, and Blackdown, and Kaffe.....
18:54 < Arricc> I've found kaffe a bit poo
18:55 < andew> broadband is great if it works properly,  unlike mine atm,  lucky to get 4..5..6KB/sec in the evenings atm
18:55 < gnufan> Funny I found Kaffe with Konqueror ran a web site that only reliably worked under IE before...
18:56 < gnufan> I think the app is using some of the relatively new bits of Java, and Kaffe is a bit behind I fear....
18:57 < andew> bbl, time to go home:)
