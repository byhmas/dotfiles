20:15 < hendry> I am trying: btdownloadcurses --max_upload_rate 5 a.torrent
20:15 -!- _UrU_ [cordoba@r200-40-239-210.adsl.anteldata.net.uy] has joined #bittorrent
20:15 < hendry> And I get a : [20:16:02] error: Too many args - 0 max
20:16 < hendry> anyone know what gives?
20:16 < DeHackEd2> btdownloadcurses --max_upload_rate 5 --responsefile a.torrent
20:17 < hendry> Oh the response file is the torrent. 
20:17 < hendry> Could be clear in the man page, than 'treat filename as a file which the server reponse was stored in. If this option is used, no filename or URL should be present on the command line.'
20:20 < DeHackEd2> "response file", "meta file" and ".torrent file" are all the same
20:21 -!- LordVan is now known as LV|off
20:21 < _UrU_> sorry, im newbie..where i get trackers?
20:21 < DeHackEd2> source code
20:23 < De_Mon> okay i just deleted a rather large torrent on acident, the inodes were recovered though, do i have to try and match these inodes to the filenames or can I i duno.. im just grasping :P
20:24 < _UrU_> when i execute for first time: "choose .torrent file to use"  <== what it is?
20:24 < Legendre> Heh, I accidentally trashed a 1G torrent the other day too.
20:24 < uau> to use the bittorrent client, you need to get a .torrent file from somewhere
20:24 < DeHackEd2> find a .torrent file online for what you want
20:24 < uau> when you give that to bittorrent, it should download the file(s) specified in the .torrent file
20:25 < _UrU_> but where i can get this .torrent?
20:25 < Gudy> 'Do Not ask where to find files'
20:25 < Gudy> that's in the topic
20:25 < Gudy> :p
20:25 < Gudy> try google :  mandrake torrent
20:25 < _UrU_> sorry, im newbie : a .torrent is file for download?
20:26 < Gudy> should give you a link
20:26 < _UrU_> a .torrent is a file for download?
20:26 < uau> a .torrent file is a file that tells bittorrent how to download the real (typically much bigger) file
20:26 < _UrU_> ahhh ok
20:27 < _UrU_> thank you, sorry for my bad english
20:29 < De_Mon> has anyone made a .torrent -> .sfv for file checking purposes?
20:29 < Bklyn> I don't think you could
20:29 < Bklyn> w/o the original files
20:30 < Bklyn> you can also "check" your files by just restarting the torrent
20:30 < De_Mon> yeah but that doesnt say which ones failed
20:31 < uau> you can't know necessarily, because it'll detect which piece failed, and a single piece can sometimes span several files
20:31 < Bklyn> oic, kind of like "cktorrent"?
20:31 < Bklyn> ala cksfv
20:31 < Bklyn> Someone was in here the other day saying they had written something like that IIRC
20:31 < uau> .torrent files can optionally include individual checksums for the files
20:32 < uau> though i don't know whether there is a tool that checks them automatically

20:35 -!- MikeW [Mike@dialup099.ts008.bmt.esat.net] has joined #bittorrent
20:36 < De_Mon> yeah but thats a file in the torrent not from the torrent itself
20:36 < De_Mon> just, a more verbose checking feature would be cool
20:36 < De_Mon> it knows file boundries so if it just marked when a file boundtry and what the file was as it was checking
20:36  * Bklyn tries the new btdownloadcurses --spew 1
20:40 < uau> did you download 5.8.2 already?
20:40 < _UrU_> yes, work good, thank you !!!

21:09 < uau> JWolf: yes, i had added my changes to 5.8.1 earlier and now added the modifications between 5.8.1 and 5.8.2 to that
21:11 < De_Mon> hooom
21:11 < De_Mon> half the inodes are rars and the rest are just 'data'
21:12 < JWolf> uau mind sending me your modded version 5.8.2 please?
21:12 < De_Mon> this could take longer than just redownloading the 1gig :p
21:12 < uau> JWolf: ok, i'll just test it once first (haven't yet downloaded anything with it)
21:12 < JWolf> Ok.. Thanks!
21:13 < Legendre> what was the issue in 5.8.1?
21:13 < JWolf> dunno
21:13 < uau> it failed when it tried to ban a peer
21:13 < JWolf> That's definatly not good
21:14 < uau> it was the same kind of bug as 5.8 had
21:14 < JWolf> Your code worked fine though
21:15 < uau> yes, the bug was in his modifications

21:21 < JWolf> Nope.
21:22 < JWolf> Try again please

21:25 < JWolf> Yep. It did. Thanks!
