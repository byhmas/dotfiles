17:35 < asuffield> does it suck less than devfs?
17:36 < Md> asuffield: much less, it's 100% userspace
17:37 < bob2> even the kernel devs don't hate it.
17:41 < ilmari> it's written by GregKH, who actually is sane (as opposed to Richard Gooch)
17:41 < StevenK> Wheee.
17:41 < StevenK> Greg K-H is a cool guy.
17:41 < ilmari> StevenK: btw, about my linda bug...
17:42 < ilmari> should I tack the no deps issue onto the non-stripped bug or report it separately?
17:42 < StevenK> If you like.
17:43 < ilmari> that was an either-or question, not a yes/no quetion
17:43 < ilmari> s,quet,quest,
17:43 < asuffield> where does it hook in, the hotplug thingy?
17:43 < ilmari> asuffield: yup
17:43 < StevenK> ilmari: Tack it on.
17:43 < teo> hmmm, www.gnu.org seems to be down
17:43 < ilmari> asuffield: and uses sysfs and a user-specified policy to create device nodes
17:44  * Md ITP sysutils too
17:44 < ilmari> it comes with some built-in policies (traditional and devfs naming, iirc
17:44 < Md> and this sucks, because there is already an unrelated and not relevant sysutils package
17:46 < ilmari> sysutils is the sysfs utils package, right?
17:47 < bob2> wow, mdz did piles of digging on my alsa-source bug.
17:47 < Md> ilmari: yes
17:47 < ilmari> Md: you could call it sysfsutils, mention sysutils in the short desc and explain in the long
17:48 < Md> either this or sys-utils, but I like more sysfsutils
17:48 < Zomb> what should I mount to make /dev/ttyXY work under kernel 2.6?
17:49 < Md> Zomb: nothing needed
17:49 < ilmari> Zomb: do you use devfs?
17:49 < Zomb> yes, devfs
17:49 < Zomb> with devfsd and symlinks seem to be okay
17:49 < ilmari> you need to mount devpts on /dev/pts
17:50 < Zomb> hm, I was sure it has been already mountet; will check later
17:50  * vorlon takes an axe to PHP upstream.
17:50 < ilmari> devfs no longer supplies that (it was duplicate functionality and required loads of crud in devfs)
17:50 < Md> ilmari: are you involved in devfs maintenance?
17:50 < Md> devfsd even
17:50 < ilmari> Md: nope
17:51 < ilmari> i just use it
17:51 < Md> I have a couple of devfs-related bugs open against module-init-tools and I'm not sure about what to do...
17:52 < Marlow> the thing about devpts was, that the functionality was better in devfs, but devpts should be up to speed now ... (if i got that right)
17:54 < ilmari> Md: my suggestion in #187681 makes stuff behave similarly to 2.4. you should also coordinate with the devfsd maintainer and both upstreams to move modprobe.devfs to devfsd

17:55 < gnarf> i found a bug in smbclient testing/unstable. (might be old). when smbclient tab completion has an empty list, it crashes with a segmentation fault.
17:55 < ilmari> Md: it's caused by the same issue as #187681
17:56 < ilmari> Md: debian's devfsd doesn't call modprobe -C /etc/modules.devfs
17:59  * Md uploads a new mutt package. enjoy.
17:59 < bob2> minus header caching?
17:59 < Czesiu> Md: 195310 is an upstream error, contrib/gpg.rc, line 59
17:59 < Czesiu> ah :)
17:59 -!- gnarf [gnarf@p508E5184.dip.t-dialin.net] has left #debian-devel []
18:00 < Md> bob2: yes
18:00 < StevenK> Oh God, no. Header caching is Good.
18:01 < bob2> YES.
18:01 < Md> StevenK: OK, send me a fixed patch then...
18:02 < StevenK> Md: Uh? Do you have a bug number?
18:02 < Czesiu> StevenK: #189999, #194843, #196832, #196978, #197182, #199052
18:02 < StevenK> RIght. Way too many.
18:05  * Czesiu has a really stupid question. Is pgp_traditional a format like: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: ...\n\nmessage\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nsig\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----?
18:05 < teo> Czesiu, afair, yes
18:05 < Md> yes
18:06 < Czesiu> great
18:06 < Czesiu> I'm going to close some bug related to it.

22:42 < srbaker> Phython: we're going to be in Ontario 01 - 10 September, basically. :
22:42 < calc> liiwi: or is it a particular page that is giving it problems?
22:43 < liiwi> calc: spewing assertion errors
22:43 < nchip> liiwi> hrm, galeon crashes every five minutes
22:44 < nchip> I think that if both are crashing liiwis problems are in somewhere else

22:47 < calc> it randomly doesn't install files for users apparently

23:02 < p2-mate> hey Yoe !
23:02 < p2-mate> Yoe: yes :)
23:02 < p2-mate> Yoe: I'm in belgium :)
23:03  * joostk sees no mention of sid libc6 problems in the topic.  anyone else having problems?
23:03 < Yoe> p2-mate: BTW, I didn't thank you for bringing that amiga yet. so... ;-)
23:03 < joostk> openoffice broke in particular
23:03 < p2-mate> Yoe: oh :)
23:03 < p2-mate> Yoe: does it work ?
23:03 < Yoe> p2-mate: not yet
23:04 < Yoe> it lacks a floppy drive *and* a hard disk
23:04 < Yoe> so I'll have to figure that out first.
23:04 < sebfrance> can anyone confirm me that the number of debian packages on file:///usr/share/apache/icons/debian/banner_v.gif is incorrect on sid?
23:04 < p2-mate> Yoe: any 2.5inch IDE disk should work
23:04 < p2-mate> Yoe: floppy is trickier
23:04 < Yoe> any IDE disk. It doesn't matter if the thing doesn't close
23:05 < p2-mate> Yoe: you need a special floppydrive to be able to do 1.44MB disks
23:05 < Yoe> yeah,
23:05 < p2-mate> Yoe: if you have the appropriate conversion yes :)
23:05 < Yoe> but there are some instructions on aminet on how to do it with a PC floppy drive
23:05 < p2-mate> Yoe: OTOH, do you need a floppy ?
23:05 < Yoe> p2-mate: uh, that's the point
23:05 < ilmari> sebfrance: that's incorrect even for woody
23:05 < p2-mate> Yoe: you can use pcmcia network
23:06 < Yoe> the reason you brought it to me is that I need to get debian-installer to work on m68k :-)
23:06 < p2-mate> Yoe: netinstall ? :P
23:06 < p2-mate> Yoe: netinstall ? :)
23:06 < ilmari> sebfrance: woody has «more than 8710 pacakges», quoting the debian.org front page
23:06 < Yoe> p2-mate: that's the first step, but not enough.
23:06 < Yoe> I have to test everything :-)

23:07 < Yoe> heh
23:07 < ilmari> sebfrance: and make it a png while you're at it :)
23:07 < sebfrance> sure
23:07 < sebfrance> I don't have any way to save it as gif as far as I've seen
23:07 -!- mait [bottoms@pool-138-88-232-100.res.east.verizon.net] has joined #debian-devel
23:08 < nchip> maybe one should create that image dynamicly while installing :)
23:09 < p2-mate> Yoe: but I did the debian install by downloading the kernel + rootimage under amiga os
23:09 < ilmari> sebfrance: you need gimp1.x-nonfree, x in {2,3}
23:09 < ilmari> depending on you gimp version
23:09 < sebfrance> ilmari: yeah, but I'll do without it
23:09 < sebfrance> thanks
23:09 < sebfrance> ilmari: do I need to get confirmed the 'bug' is also in sid or can I send it right away?
23:09 < p2-mate> Yoe: and boot all this using amiboot
23:10 < ilmari> sebfrance: the sid version says 2283 packages, >500 developers
23:10 < ilmari> and Four CD's
23:10 < sebfrance> ilmari: ok thanks,
23:10 < p2-mate> Yoe: I don't there ever have been real bootfloppy images for debian on the amiga
23:11 < Yoe> p2-mate: you're not the only one. Moreover, for m68k macs, it's th ony _possible_ way :-)
23:11 < ilmari> just make the sid version the same as the woody one and remember to update it before sarge
23:11 < Yoe> p2-mate: IIRC, it's not possible.
23:11 < p2-mate> Yoe: amiboot is the only booter on the amiga
23:11 < Yoe> however, that doesn't mean I don't want to try it :-)
23:11 < ilmari> when we know the the approximate final size
23:11 < p2-mate> Yoe: it is possible I think, but I'm not sure if it makes sense to do it :)
23:12 < Yoe> heh
23:12 < Yoe> oh well. I'll find out once I get it to work :-)
