22:29 < hendry> If I plan to have my repo off in my univ shell, do I need to have svn bins there too?
22:31 < mbk> yup.
22:34 < hendry> I seem to have 33.0 on my unstable
22:35 < hendry> If I install 33.1 on my uni shell, will I have any issues?
22:35 < mbk> no.
22:36 < mbk> .33.1 is supposed to work with .32.0 to .34.99999999
22:37 < hendry> about the svn bins on my shell. Do I have to run a process there if I have my repo there?
22:37 < hendry> or the svn bins are just there to create and manage the repo?
22:37 < mbk> depends on what RA method you use
22:38 < hendry> export CVSROOT=hendry@melkinpaasi.cs.helsinki.fi:/home/fs/hendry/cvs == svn+ssh://hendry@melkinpaasi.cs.helsinki.fi/home/hendry/svn
22:38 < mbk> ah, svn+ssh
22:38 < hendry> something like that?
22:38 < mbk> so, no, you don't need to have any processes running.
22:38 < sabi> with svn+ssh, you're only running svn while you're in the process of accessing the repository.  you don't need a daemon or anything.
22:39 < hendry> Ok, so it should hopefully behave the same with the CVS export command
22:40 < mbk> hmm?
22:40 < mbk> svn doesn't look at the CVSROOT environment variable.
22:41 < hendry> ok, I understand that
22:41 < hendry> is there some environment variable it looks at? I don't like the idea of typing out the full URL
22:41 < mbk> you can use whichever one you want. :-)
22:41  * hendry goes back to book
22:42 < mbk> export SVNROOT=svn+ssh://hendry@melkinpaasi.cs.helsinki.fi/home/hendry/svn
22:42 < mbk> svn co $SVNROOT
22:42 < mbk> :-)
22:42 < breser> Someone needs to get around to fixing it so you can make "shortcuts" for urls.
22:43 < mbk> I would rather we had something like:
22:43 -!- Elmoe [~elmoe@h209-71-217-225.gtconnect.net] has joined #svn
22:43 < mbk> svn connect myname SOME_URL
22:43 < mbk> svn co myname:/branches/foo
22:43 < mbk> or something like that.
22:43 < sabi> yeah...
22:43 < breser> That's kinda what I meant.
22:43 < mbk> then the URL can leave the WC (issue 960)
22:44 < sabi> as is, for svn+ssh just configuring stuff in .ssh/config handles most of it, but it doesn't handle path abstraction
22:44 < sabi> yay for old issues :)
22:44 < mbk> it also makes "svn switch --relocate" an O(1) operation
22:44 < mbk> (it just rewrites the config file that knows what name goes to what URL)
22:44 < mbk> instead of rewriting every entries file.
22:45 < breser> Humm.
22:46 < breser> And instead of using the full URL in all the entries file you use what some generated number?
22:46 < breser> In the case of someone not having done a connect?
22:47 < hendry> Has anyone managed to version their Mozilla bookmarks?
22:47 < mbk> breser: you mean the repository-UUID? :-)
22:47 < breser> mbk -> Yup that would do the trick.
22:48 < breser> I like that to a point.
22:48 < breser> I also like being able to move working copies between machines without any difficulties.
22:48 < mbk> yes, that's one of the problems.
22:49 < mbk> but svn could prompt you... "unconnected WC, enter URL:"
22:49 < breser> True.
22:49 -!- myg [myg@lumberjack.snurgle.org] has joined #svn
22:49 < mbk> or you could have an "svn decouple" which would push all the config info into the WC
22:50 < mbk> I like the prompting, personally.
22:50 < breser> Prompting would be better.
22:50 < breser> I use rsync to move my wc between my desktop and laptop.
22:50 < mbk> you'd only have to do it once per repository
22:50 < myg> Anybody have any luck compiling neon (standalone or in SVN tree) when expat and libxml are in /usr/local? (Seems no matter what neon refuses to find expat on this particular system)
22:50 < breser> mbk -> *nod*
22:51 < mbk> Philip Martin pointed out another place where it falls down: multiple access paths to the same repo
22:52 < breser> Just make it so the confs can store multiple access paths.
22:52 < breser> Make it so you can choose a preference for which one to use.
22:53 < breser> And make it try them in descending preference order.
22:53 < mbk> (I was suggesting having *only* the UUID in the WC)
22:53 < thom> myg: pass --with-expat to configure? or whatever the neon flag is?
22:54 < myg> thom: Did that, --with-expat won't take a path and it seems intent on not looking in /usr/local
22:54 < myg> thom: Interesting side-note. --with-expat in SVN *does* take a path, but then calls neon's configure which barfs with the path. 
22:54 < myg> thom: If you don't specify a path in the SVN one, SVN barfs before it gets to neon. 
22:57 < breser> mbk -> Store the UUID + a hash of the URL?
22:57 < breser> Then handle it like so.
22:58 < thom> myg: ah, interesting
22:58 < breser> If it can't find a pair that matches it uses the first one it finds that matches the UUID.
22:58 < myg> thom: Very, for us with old BSD boxen that don't have expat as part of the default install..... I'm reluctant to put it in /usr (that just isn't the way its supposed to be done!)
22:59 < myg> thom: I just want a statically linked SVN client anyhow (no shlibs)...
22:59 < CIA> dionisos committed revision 7887: Correction for r7886: Prevent undefined behaviour as
22:59 < thom> can't you use the expat in apr-util?
22:59 < thom> in the svn tarball already
23:00 < myg> thom: How do I make it do that? A straight SVN configure (0.33.1) fails saying it can't find an XML parser. 
23:00 < myg> thom: Oddly enough, if I build all of Apache and point SVN to Apache's APR (not the in-SVN-tree one), it works -- this machine has functioned as a server; but now I want to make a client only build.
23:02 < thom> well, why not point to apache's apr for the client too?
23:03 < myg> thom: Because I don't want to carry all the bulk of Apache over to all these client machines (with small disks). 
23:03 < myg> thom: Maybe if I statically link it, but I've seen it where it still wants some stuff dynamically linked. 
23:13 < myg> thom: Hmmm.... if I set LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS it works. Maybe Joe should put that in as a FAQ or tweak his AC stuff a little?

23:52 < Vurlix> Hi... i set up svnserve, but it seems like it's letting anyone read and write access to the repository regardless of svnserve.conf or the passwd db file
23:53 < Vurlix> this is on win32.. any idea why this would happen?
