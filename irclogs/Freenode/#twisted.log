13:20 < tjs> how did 2.5 turn out?
13:20 < spiv> Works so far :)
13:20 < spiv> Except my mousewheel has stopped working.
13:21 < sjj> haha! living on the edge indeed.
13:21 < tjs> know much about t.i.threads spiv?
13:21 < tjs> heh
13:21 < spiv> sjj: It's worse than you think ;)
13:21 < sjj> :)
13:21 < spiv> sjj: I'm using a snapshot of 2.5, rather than a release.
13:21 < sjj> I don't have a mousewheel
13:21 < spiv> sjj: And I compiled it with gcc-3.3.
13:21 < sjj> spiv: hee!
13:22 < tjs> OMG you poor deprived person.. how to you exist without a mousewheel?
13:22 < spiv> sjj: I was basically hoping to break it so horridly that I could stop being leet and get back to doing productive stuff, but so far it's all too good :)
13:22 < tjs> how do you scroll?
13:22  * tjs grins.
13:22 < spiv> tjs: By ignoring the mouse altogether ;)
13:22 < sjj> with the keyboard mostly.
13:22 < sjj> spiv: :)
13:23 < spiv> I really should've done some benchmarks or something before I rebooted ;)
13:24 < spiv> Oh well, I'll just assume it's faster ;)
13:24 < tjs> forgent kernel upgrades, the biggest increase in speed/responsivness I got was when I descovered hdparm ;)
13:25 < moshez> spiv: it is squishy!
13:26 < spiv> Oh, been there, done that ;)
13:26 < spiv> moshez: G'afternoon!
13:26 < spiv> tjs: Partly, I'm hoping that if 2.5 seems usuable, I could then use it on my nForce2 box, rather than fighting with 2.4 and backporting drivers and whatnot.
13:26 < moshez> spiv: I radiate lots of evil today
13:26 < spiv> moshez: G'evening, even!
13:27 < moshez> spiv: ha! I radiate evil to darken your day
13:27 < moshez> muhahahaahahahahaha
13:27 < moshez> silly upside-down person
13:28 -!- stranger [~stranger@81-6-217-244.gotadsl.co.uk] has joined #twisted
13:28 < tjs> so does anyone know if I can somehow have a deffered in my method list to callMultipleInThread ?
13:28 < spiv> tjs: Huh?
13:28 < spiv> "method list"?
13:29 < tjs> well there is deferToThread for a single function/method call
13:29 < tjs> or callMultipleInThread and you can pass a list
13:29 < tjs> tuple actually
13:30 < spiv> Right.
13:30 < tjs> why is there a deffered specific method?
13:30 < spiv> callMultipleInThread doesn't return anything though.
13:30 < spiv> It's merely for running the methods, rather than collecting the results.
13:30 < spiv> (which seems like an oversight, but perhaps this code predates DeferredList?)
13:30 < tjs> ah..
13:30  * stranger looks at the topic
13:31 < stranger> i'm not alone in being an utter idiot? yay!
13:32 < tjs> er.. wow
13:33 < tjs> I just accidently discovered a cool feature of konqueror :) you can browse and view the contents of a compressed archive, so you can view all the twisted docs without unpacking :)
13:34 < tjs> okay perhaps not 'wow' worthy but kinda cool
13:36 < stranger> konqueror rocks
13:37 < stranger> especially fish:// (the ssh vfs)
13:37 < tjs> gt fish?
13:38 < tjs> like ftp/ssh?
13:38 < stranger> ssh
13:40 -!- glyph [glyph@adsl-64-123-27-109.dsl.austtx.swbell.net] has joined #twisted
13:40 < tjs> does it open ssh as a term or file browsing via ssh?
13:40 < stranger> e.g. fish://user@host/path/to/homedir gives you a fully-functional browser window on your remote home
13:40 < tmcvs> Commit from glyph (added 3, changed 1) in 2 subdirs of Twisted/twisted: "demoware hack" twistd.py, gladereactor.py, gladereactor.gladep, gladereactor.glade
13:40 < glyph> helo
13:40 < tjs> wow
13:40 < tjs> thats rly cool
13:41 < stranger> it even does file previewing over ssh (although that's slightly insane)
13:41 < tjs> lol
13:42 < tjs> not for LANs, at work we ssh all over the office
13:42 < stranger> nods
13:42 < moshez> hello small glyph-like squishy person
13:42 < glyph> hi moshez
13:42 < tjs> is fish a plugin to download? I dont seem to have it
13:43 < stranger> tjs: yeah
13:44 < glyph> gah
13:44 < glyph> mcp33p4n75 is asking me to take him off the #python banlist.
13:44 < glyph> ircing as root, I think.
13:45 < stranger> tjs: in debian its part of kdebase-kio-plugins
13:46 < tjs> you auto-ban people for IRCing as root?
13:48 < glyph> tjs: for their own good
13:48 < glyph> seriously
13:49 < tjs> *lol* :)
13:50 < liiwi> glyph: and if they are using ssh port forwarding that borks ident?
13:51 < glyph> liiwi: that's a shame
13:52 < hendry> glyph: You know Amir Bakhtiar right?
13:55 < moshez> glyph: how do you know he ircs as root?
13:55 < moshez> glyph: I once had a machine configured to answer "root" to all identd requests
14:04 < Yhg1s> either they IRC as root or they pretend to IRC as root; both is silly.
14:04 < moshez> Yhg1s: I suck
14:04 < moshez> Yhg1s: squish squish!
14:05 < moshez> Yhg1s: are you giving any talks at EP?
14:05 < Yhg1s> nope
14:05 < Yhg1s> I won't be coming to EP even.
14:05 < Yhg1s> don't have the time
14:05  * moshez kills Yhg1s cruelly
14:05 < moshez> you hate me!
14:06 < Yhg1s> nope
14:06 < Yhg1s> my work hates me :)
14:06 < Yhg1s> "work, bitch!" it says. "Work work work!"
14:06 < Yhg1s> if I hadn't already scheduled a talk for OSCON2003, I would be skipping that too.
14:06  * moshez hugs Yhg1s
14:07 < moshez> Yhg1s: now you won't get squished by me
14:07 < Yhg1s> heh, have you been taking drugs again ? your mood swings are impressive. :)
14:07 < tjs> wtf? you have to pay to download from apps.kde.org?
14:07 < Yhg1s> so, anyone available to give some twisted advice ?
14:09 < moshez> Yhg1s: "just ask"
14:09  * moshez squishes Yhg1s
14:09 < moshez> Yhg1s: I was talking about real life squishing
14:09 < moshez> the kind where you hurt because IT IS PURE EVIL!!!!!
14:10 < Yhg1s> I want to make a TCP gateway that does some fiddling with the data stream
14:10 < moshez> Yhg1s: you probably wanna start by looking at t.i.portforwarder
14:10 < Yhg1s> client connects to port, daemon connects to server, funnels data to and fro.
14:10 < moshez> Yhg1s: and then ask more :)
14:11 < Yhg1s> I can't seem to wrap my head aroud the protocol-versus-implementation difference in the quoters example ;P
14:11 < Yhg1s> I'll look at that, thanks.
14:11 < moshez> Yhg1s: less trivial to do that without race conditions than it seems
14:11 < moshez> Yhg1s: :(
14:11 < Yhg1s> race conditions ? having fiddled data and unfiddled data appear out of order or something ?
14:12 < moshez> no

14:12 < Yhg1s> oh, not an issue.
14:12 < moshez> ah, it has a "welcome message"?
14:12 < Yhg1s> yes.
14:14 < moshez> Yhg1s: anyhow t.i.portforwarder does everything, if you need no modification
14:14 < moshez> er.

15:56 < Riastradh> Hi.
15:57 < DrConrad> hello
15:57 < DrConrad> I am trying to move from PHP to twisted web.
15:57 < DrConrad> good idea?
15:57 < Riastradh> Yes.
15:58 < DrConrad> hmmm. what the reliability of the web server compared to apache?
15:58 < Riastradh> It seems OK to me.
15:59 < DrConrad> yeah, I've had it running for a few days. I only got on weird exception... can't remember what it was.
15:59 < Riastradh> Did the whole thing die or did you just get an odd log message?
15:59 < DrConrad> just an odd message
16:00 < DrConrad> so it didn't crash and burn... :)
16:00 < Riastradh> Good!
16:00 < DrConrad> this may be a n00b question... but how do I get access to form and querystring variables? it's driving me nuts. I can't find anything in the tutorials or qoogle...
16:02 < DrConrad> anyone?
16:03 < _moshez> the "request" object

16:40 < sjj> (just from a quick browse of the source)

20:59 < itamar> exarkun: you going to deal with the patch on the list?
21:00 < exarkun> Unless you want to
21:01 < exarkun> It all looks pretty good, except for that one wierd part of the API he added
21:02 < itamar> well, I don't know that code at all
21:02 < itamar> ask him about it?
21:02 < exarkun> Yea, when I finish playing with pop3 :)
21:03 < itamar> I think glyph and I will implement The Game of Zap today
21:04 < exarkun> Sounds neat.  What's that?
21:04 < itamar> you have to have CVS rights to play
21:05 < itamar> adding tests gives you points
21:06 < itamar> and many more rules we'll write down when we implement it
21:06 < exarkun> hah, cool :)
21:08 < Tv> itamar: Have you seen the (former) Netfilter scoretable?
21:08 < itamar> nope
21:08  * itamar googles
21:09 < Tv> Try the web history services.
21:09 < itamar> I, found it
21:10 < itamar> well, the difference in our case is that to some degree it will be automated
21:11 < itamar> and you *don't* automatically get points for new features
21:11 < itamar> unless your fellow programmers vote for it
21:11 < itamar> the main way of getting points is tests
21:12 < itamar> looks like the netfilter one didn't work because points were manual
21:12 < Tv> unit testing kernel code is a bitch.
21:12 < Tv> BTDT

00:13 -!- glyph changed the topic of #twisted to: Yes, Pyramid is down again.  This time, it died with some video memory corruption.  We suspect a hardware problem.  Stay tuned.
00:13 -!- TTimo [~timo@ATuileries-102-1-2-18.w193-253.abo.wanadoo.fr] has quit ["QuIRC for *nix - http://quirc.org/"]
00:13 < radix> glyph: hmm
00:13 < radix> glyph: That last stack trace _did_ say something about vga
00:14 < liiwi> glyph: do you have framebuffer enable on console?
00:14 < Pahan> So the frontend prints out stats every 2 seconds. When client is used as a seed client with the tracker, tracker will likewise be notified of client's progress.
00:15 -!- len [~pyscho@node-423a2e2d.sfo.onnet.us.uu.net] has left #twisted []
00:15 < glyph> liiwi: no.
00:15 < liiwi> just 80x25 text mode?
00:15 < glyph> yup.
00:16 < liiwi> iirc the default kernels also have framebuffer enabled
00:18 < Pahan> Which is why you specify "video=vga16:off" in cmdline on Debian default installations.
00:19 < glyph> hmm.
00:21 < liiwi> just a thing, but make sure the display card is seated properly
00:21 < glyph> so, cpuburn didn't cause problems
00:21 < glyph> memtest didn't cause problems
00:21 < glyph> liiwi: display card is onboard
00:21 < glyph> but
00:21 < glyph> when I started doing something to the _disk_
00:21 < glyph> it immediately crashed
00:22 < Pahan> glyph: What motherboard is in the computer/
00:22 < liiwi> disk controller or cable is busted
00:22 < liiwi> did anything get to logs?
00:22 < Pahan> If it's famous VIA chipset of death...
00:23 < liiwi> incidentally in finnish, 'viallinen' means 'something with a via' or 'faulty'. ('vika' = 'fault').
00:26 < liiwi> I'm off to bedwards. nini
00:27 < MFen> so via chipsets are bad?
00:27 < MFen> didn't know that.  that may explain why my current computer is such a useless hunk of metal
00:27 < Pahan> Some Athlon chipsets are notoriously unstable because of disk controllers on them.
00:28 < MFen> that sounds like me
00:28 -!- buildbot [~buildbot@adsl-64-123-27-105.dsl.austtx.swbell.net] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
00:28 < MFen> via, athlon, and certain types of disk operations cause hangs and whatnot

00:28 < MFen> i decided to scrap the whole system and start fresh next time. i don't need avery expensive set anyway
