22:28 -lilo(levin@lilo.staff.freenode)- [Global Notice] Hi all.  We just experienced a very interesting problem with services and an EU hub.  We're investigating, and suspect it won't recur anytime soon.
22:33 -lilo(levin@lilo.staff.freenode)- [Global Notice] Hi all.  Please bear with us, we *may* have a major dehubbing and rehubbing in just a sec.
22:34 -lilo(levin@lilo.staff.freenode)- [Global Notice] Looks like not.  Thanks for your patience.

17:37 -lilo(levin@lilo.staff.freenode)- [Global Notice] Hi all. We're working on an alternative approach to providing system status, which should result in the elimination of global notices.  Please message me if you have any comments, positive or negative; and we'll have something up on the news site when we're ready to go with it.  Thanks.
17:41 -lilo(levin@lilo.staff.freenode)- [Global Notice] I'll respond slowly to those who have commented.  Thanks again for your input.
