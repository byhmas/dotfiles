17:06 -!- Irssi: Starting query in Freenode with dlite
17:06 <dlite> I want to write python parser which will convert xml file into html
17:10 <hendry> I would probably use DOM. Although if you need it fast, SAX
17:10 <hendry> OR you could use mozilla. A style sheet perhaps?
17:10 <dlite> python SAX check dtd before parse?
17:10 <dlite> or dtd don't needed in that case?
17:11 <hendry> I don't know. I am no expert. All I know is on my tips page
17:11 <dlite> are you here?
17:11 <hendry> I don't know. I am no expert. All I know is on my tips page
17:11 <dlite> well, tnx anyway
17:11 <dlite> bye
17:11 <hendry> bye
