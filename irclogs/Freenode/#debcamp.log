23:16 < nchip> I dont think so
23:17 < nchip> Gym is the place we are supposed to go to sleep
23:17 < ToreSB> k
23:17 < agonyzer> ifi is closed at night
23:17 < ToreSB> nope

23:18 < agonyzer> guess why you got locked in ...
23:18 < ToreSB> no card  lol

23:24 < ToreSB> (emulated)
23:24 < p2-mate> not the real thing ? :)
23:24 < p2-mate> is the PDP-7 already working ?
23:24 < ToreSB> That's for later ;)
23:24 < ToreSB> Nope
23:24 < p2-mate> too bas
23:24 < p2-mate> too bad
23:24 < p2-mate> what's missing ?
23:24 < ToreSB> I have been working a long time on it
23:25 < ToreSB> p2-mate, everything but core memory
23:25 < p2-mate> oh
23:25 < p2-mate> that's annoying
23:25 < ToreSB> lol
23:25 < p2-mate> we need core memory obviously
23:25 < ToreSB> obv. yeah
23:25 < ToreSB> i mean
23:25 < ToreSB> nothing but core memory *****
23:26 < ToreSB> quite differen
23:26 < p2-mate> true
23:26 < p2-mate> should be fun to have your main memory non-volatile
23:26 < ToreSB> the CPU works to an extent
23:27 < p2-mate> cool
23:27 < ToreSB> p2-mate, wiring problems makes it volatile due to power surges
23:27 < p2-mate> oh
23:27 < p2-mate> ic
23:27 < hendry> ToreSB: is that you Danish Troels?
23:27 < p2-mate> but core memory as such is non-volatile iirc
23:27 < ToreSB> hendry, I'm the guy with him all the time :)
23:27 < ToreSB> turn it off and it *should* still keep its contents
23:28 < ToreSB> Actually, magnetic RAM is making a comeback
23:28 < p2-mate> I know
23:28 < p2-mate> FRAM
23:28 < ToreSB> that's it
23:28 < p2-mate> FerroMagnetic RAM 
23:28 < ToreSB> mmmm --- ferrite core... *drools*
23:28 < p2-mate> :)
23:29 < ToreSB> actually, there are some dodgy wirings here and there
23:29 < ToreSB> which is easy to fiz
23:29 < ToreSB> fix*
23:29 < ToreSB> But the problem is - where should I start?
23:29 < p2-mate> yeah
23:29 < p2-mate> good question :)
23:29 < p2-mate> I never tried to debug such a beast :)
23:29 < ToreSB> I mean; I can take nothing for granted
23:30 < ToreSB> I thought of the timing chain
23:30 < ToreSB> but what if it isn't initiated? then what?
23:31 < ToreSB> and so on and so forth
23:31 < hendry> damn my wrist watch is losing time
23:32 < p2-mate> ToreSB: I would say try part by part ?
23:33 < ToreSB> yeah
23:33 < ToreSB> hendry, my wristwatch has unstable drivers
23:39 < p2-mate> hehe
