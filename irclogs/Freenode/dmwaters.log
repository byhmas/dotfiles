20:19 -dmwaters(dmwaters@dmwaters.staff.freenode)- {global notice} Hi all. The netsplits you saw earlier were because one of our main rotation servers had some network problems. We are in need of new main rotation servers, and hubs for the us. If you are interested in sponsoring a server please look at http://www.freenode.net/sponsoring_servers.shtml Thanks, and thank you for using freenode!
