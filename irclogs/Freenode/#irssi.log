21:43 < solicit> irssi vs other clients
21:44 < solicit> completely balanced teams :)
21:45 < elho> Dooku: in a connection, dunno. but to see what a server accepts, theres sclient or however it was called
21:46 < Dooku> elho: yes, but the server accepts 56 to 168 bit connections, i don't know which cipher irssi uses

23:12 < hendry> is there some way of writing a plugin for irssi in python ?
23:12 < tfing> not for the moment
23:12 < coekie> no (at least not yet)
23:13 < caphuso> hendry: sure. first step: add python support to irssi...
23:13 < bob2> not unless you want to write the python plugin, first :-)
23:15 < hendry> I guess I could use /exec -out instead
23:16 < hendry> Just want to output what song I am playing. the xmms plugin I am using sucks
23:16 < bob2> xmms.pl?
23:16 < hendry> yes
23:18 < bob2> how bad can it suck?
23:18 < tam> off topic: does anyone know if solaris has a restart option for init.d scripts? (just asking because i'm reading the documentation and it says stop and then start, not just restart)
23:18 < bob2> it's only 60 lines of perl :)
23:23 < hednod> anyone have any idea why irssi would keep whoising someone on my notify list
23:23 < coekie> hednod: you use the -idle thing?
23:23 < hednod> coekie: yup
23:23 <@Shruuf> that's it
23:23 < coekie> well, the only way to check idle time, is to whois
23:23 < hednod> ah
23:24 < coekie> but irssi should hide that, you shouldn't really see that ;)
23:24 < hednod> well they should put a warning in the notify help page
23:24 < hednod> "will cause massive /whois spam"
23:24 < hednod> when i just startup the client, it doesn't do it

15:40 < hendry> I keep getting "(Unauthorized connection)" when I try connect to IRCNet servers. Can someone enlighten me why?
15:41 <@Geert> Sure, you are not Ilined
15:41 <@Geert> You must find a server fitting your IP-range
15:41 < lash_> hendry: try irc1.inet.fi
15:41 < lash_> hendry: sonera's clients should get there

20:57 < hendry> How do I get irssi to parse latin-1 while using uxterm ?
20:57 < Stric> recode.pl is one way
20:58 < thomas_N> can i deal with utf-8 as well using this script?
20:58 < hendry> zgrep -i utf actually is coming up with something
20:59 < Stric> thomas_N: I use recode.pl to have utf8 for some channels in my latin1 term.. it can encode in various ways back and forth with fallbacks etc
21:00 -!- dryan [dryan@80.195.26.94] has quit [Client Quit]
21:00 < thomas_N> i'll have a look. As long as aterm doesn't support utf-8 i have to stick to ISO-something
21:02 < hendry> Can't locate package Irssi::Nick for @Irssi::Irc::Nick::ISA at (eval 18) line 24.
21:02 < hendry> for recode.pl ...
21:02 < hendry> I so hate perl
21:03 < hendry> uxterm++ :)
21:04 < thomas_N> hendry: uxterm doesn't have (fake) transparency and fading
21:04 < hendry> thomas_N: you're lame :)
21:04 < thomas_N> hmm, same error message here, hendry :(
21:04 < thomas_N> hey, i also use OS X, i need stuff like that!
