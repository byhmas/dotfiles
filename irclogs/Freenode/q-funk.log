19:20 -!- Irssi: Starting query in Freenode with Q-FUNK
19:20 <Q-FUNK> looks good.
19:20 <Q-FUNK> I would have put a firm, 1 release every year, though.
19:21 <Q-FUNK> this "release once every 1 or 2 years" bit is a bit confusing.

19:38 <hendry> I mean 1 to 2
19:38 <hendry> oops
19:39 <Q-FUNK> yep, but that's what I mean.  there should be a firm release cycle.
19:40 <hendry> well, it's based on stable.
19:42 <hendry> well, it went right to last second
19:44 <Q-FUNK> so I can imagine. :)

21:52 <Q-FUNK> howdy
21:52 <hendry> lo
21:52 <Q-FUNK> yAschwin said you mailed him.  he was pleasantly surprised with your idea. he seems ot think that Linux Aktivaattori could help.
21:54 <hendry> I was not so keen on the whole thing. Everyone else seems to be though. 
21:55 <hendry> I will be giving a demo to some CS dept staff next week
21:55 <hendry> on that basis the Head of Dept might throw some money/people at it
21:55 <Q-FUNK> you really wanted that remote storage idea implemented eh?
21:55 <hendry> Oh there are implementations already
21:57 <Q-FUNK> i know
21:57 <Q-FUNK> but none are winning any market yet
21:57 <Q-FUNK> same problem with virtual homedirs as a hosted service, like the dot-mac concept.
21:57 <Q-FUNK> it's not flying yet.
