21:15 < hendry> Is it possible to store mutt's addressbook into my courier imap service?
21:16 < hendry> I can see you do have an addressbook in the webmail
21:16 < hendry> although I don't see it show up in the IMAP folder listing
21:18 < Feyr-Wrk> why would imap (a message store) store address books (LDAP) ?
21:19 < hendry> good point
21:19 < hendry> well, I have a problem. i want my addressbook availible wherever I check my mail
21:19 < hendry> atm it is a mutt type alias file
21:19 < hendry> I have never used LDAP
21:20 < hendry> can I store my own addresses into an LDAP server (as a user)?
21:20 < Feyr-Wrk> not sure, i haven't looked at it yet. but i don't think so
21:21 < hendry> well IMAP allows me to check me email wherever using different devices
21:21 < hendry> but I don't have my blasted addressbook with me
21:31 < kpettit> Q;  When a messages is re-jected for whatever reason is the origional header always sent back?
21:32 < Feyr-Wrk> by courier? yes. by other MTA? no necessarly
21:33 < kpettit> ah.  I'm more worried about others
21:34 < Feyr-Wrk> you dont need the headers anyway
21:34 < Feyr-Wrk> it's impossible to parse
21:36 < kpettit> hummm

23:00 -!- fra [~fra@154.Red-217-127-168.pooles.rima-tde.net] has joined #courier
23:00 < fra> Hello :)
23:00 < fra> I'm having a strange problem with Courier-IMAP 2.1.2
23:00 < fra> very strange indeed
23:01 < fra> POP3 runs perfectly, auths my users against my postgresql database
23:01 < fra> but IMAP doesn't
23:01 < fra> It only accepts my users if the UID field doesn't have a "@"
23:02 < fra> Courier 1.4.3 worked without problems, what can I do?
23:03 < fra> hello?
23:03 < fra> anyone here?
23:03 < fra> heeeelloooooooooooo
23:14  * fra is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
