21:05 <part> back now..
21:06 <part> the main issue about the network was that there were 11 people (or househoulds) interested, and that was just too little
21:07 <hendry> oh no
21:07 <part> he asked some people, like me, and got the number of people up to 14, which was enough to warrant the deal
21:07 <part> so it is going to happen
21:08 <hendry> ah sweet
21:08 <part> you really should learn finnish ;)
21:08 <hendry> when?
21:10 <part> no schedule yet, he was going to talk with the dsl provider tomorrow or so, should know more about it in a few days
21:10 <part> or maybe Laturi should learn to speak english :)
21:12 <part> do you speak anything else besides english?
21:14 <hendry> i am learning German

21:25 <part> you can almost always think of better ways to spend time
21:26 <part> :)
21:26 <part> have you got a spare UTP cable?
21:27 <hendry> hmmm
21:28 <hendry> I do, but I think I packed it away
21:29 <hendry> no I don't 
21:29 <hendry> I can't be bothered to go up to storage and find it
21:29 <hendry> wait let me ask me flat mate

22:17 <part> perhaps
22:18 <hendry> ;)
22:18 <part> I don't have timestamps here, I have no idea how long ago you said that :)
22:21 <hendry> about 2 hours ago
22:21 <part> oh :)
22:21 <hendry> you're welcome still. i slept this afternoon so i have a couple of hours left in me at least
22:23 <part> I've been busy configuring some stuff, and I want to get it done today..
22:24 <hendry> ok. what is it btw? :)
22:25 <part> sql-ledger
22:25 <part> the largest problem is that someone else has hand-compiled apache and lots of other stuff even though it's a debian system
22:27 <hendry> sql-ledger sucks. I tried it, in mind for my parents
22:27 <hendry> but that was about 2 years ago
22:30 <part> I'm not going to be using it, I'm installing it for others to use in a project
22:30 <part> gaah1
22:30 <part> !
22:30 <part> I hate vim
22:30 <part> and my keyboard
22:31 <part> my left shift key is broken, it sometimes fails
22:31 <hendry> left shift and vim?
22:31 <part> unrelated things :)
22:31 <part> vim is trying to be too clever and indents apache config when it doesn't really know how to indent it
22:32 <part> luckily there is nvi
22:34 <hendry> what you mean? when you paste?
22:34 <hendry> I swapped that 3com card for another 2nd hand one, and I think it is also not working
22:34 <part> no, when I press tab
22:35 <hendry> Could you please give me the link to the cheapest lookin' PCI combo card on kauppa.iqs.fi?
22:35 <hendry> tabs are EVIL
22:37 <part> vim is evil

22:54 <part> ehh.. I meant to ask if you're using rcs
22:54 <hendry> I use CVS
22:54 <hendry> RCS is the older version right? 
22:55 <hendry> I use it on my tips and tricks page
22:55 <hendry> RCS that is
22:55 <part> ok
22:55 <part> cvs is an extension on top of rcs
22:55 <part> rcs handles single files, and essentially so does cvs
22:55 <part> I've been looking at subversion today...
22:59 <hendry> comments then ? 
22:59 <hendry> i keep forgetting howto setup a new repr in CVS

23:10 <part> I'm aiming to have all of my own projects under subversion from now on
23:11 <part> got sql-ledger to work a while ago
23:11 <hendry> is it as sucky as I remember it?
23:12 <part> I don't know how you remember it :)
23:12 <part> seems like it could be useful if you need such a tool
23:12 <part> I don't personally, so I really can't tell whether it's sucky or not
23:15 <hendry> http://www.sql-ledger.org/cgi-bin/users.pl
23:15 <hendry> add to the lusers? :)
23:17 <part> technically I'm not using it :)
