22:09 < hendry> How do I configure VIM to resume editing where I was last editing in a file, saved and quit?
22:10 < lypanov> no idea. but mine started doing it
22:10 < lypanov> wow
22:10 < lypanov> that tutorial with the screen shots is waaaaay cool
22:10 < LeChef> :mksession iirc
22:10 < lypanov> the minibuf thingy is sweeeeeeeeeeeet
22:13 < Lurch_> is there an autocmd event I can use to detect a resize of the window?
22:18 < lypanov> sweeeeeet
22:18 < lypanov> hint: sigwinch
22:19 < lypanov> though i don't know the autocmd
22:19 < Lurch_> k, thanks
22:19 < LeChef> Termchanged maybe
22:20 < hendry> LeChef: it is not working...
22:21 < hendry> LeChef: it is in the FAQ :http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/vimfaq2html3.pl#5.6
22:21 < LeChef> maybe :help session will help
22:23 < lypanov> MetaCosm: thank you very much for the tutorial page. nice stuff
22:23 < lypanov> MetaCosm: and i'm seen as the company vim guru :)

22:58 < MetaCosm> I am working on a "tips" page :) 
22:58 < lypanov> very cool :)
22:58 < MetaCosm> which is going to be a bunch of commands
22:58 < MetaCosm> that are useful
22:58 < MetaCosm> like . and *
22:59 < MetaCosm> and so forth
22:59 < MetaCosm> but hand picked by #vim people (unlike the general [and wonderful] tips from vim.sf.net)
22:59 < lypanov> this ones nice btw:
22:59 < lypanov> VI - "Byw                  append the word the contents of the named buffer b.
22:59 < MetaCosm> one NICE command
22:59 < MetaCosm> is being able to autocomplete a line
22:59 < MetaCosm> I just always forget the command.
23:00 < lypanov> autocomplete a line?
23:00 < MetaCosm> yeah
23:00 < lypanov> how on earth would that work? :)
23:00 < MetaCosm> control-n and control-p complete "words"
23:01 < MetaCosm> but -- lines can be complete
23:01 < lypanov> cool. never realized that
23:01 < lypanov> CTRL-X CTRL-L

23:02 < lypanov> vim's help is brilliant
23:02 < lypanov> thats what makes me use it i think
23:02 < lypanov> emacs help was dreadful last time i tried
23:02 < lypanov> i use ruby over perl for the same reason
23:03 < MetaCosm> I like vim because it allows me to be brief
23:03 < MetaCosm> with keystrokes
23:04 < lypanov> yes. i get annoying rsi without vim
23:04 < lypanov> thats why i use it ;-)
23:05 < MetaCosm> also -- working consistantly across platforms is nice
23:06 < lypanov> yes. very
23:06 < lypanov> i learnt vim on windows actually :)
23:06 < MetaCosm> and -- consistant between langauges (keywords are always X color)
23:06 < lypanov> though i'm a full time linux guy now
23:06 < MetaCosm> unlike freaking emacs and "modes"
23:06 < MetaCosm> which totally change the way you edit
23:06 < MetaCosm> based on the language you are editting.
23:07 < lypanov> btw. how do you get the little minibufferlist in the screenie in your tutorial?
23:12 < MetaCosm> hmm
23:12 < MetaCosm> let me check my screenshot :) 
23:13 < lypanov> hehe :)
23:14 < MetaCosm> ah.
23:14 < MetaCosm> the top thing
23:14 < MetaCosm> hold up :) 
23:14 < MetaCosm> I don't use that anymore.
23:15 < lypanov> any other suggestions?
23:15 < lypanov> main thing is that i need a quick way of getting from one window to another
23:15 < lypanov> and currently i'm finding it difficult with around 10 windows ;-)
23:15 < lypanov> and i never really split unless using vimdiff or something like that ;-)

23:50 < Guyuttee> for instance in a english text, to have a <greek></greek> part or some other tagging displayed with the corresponding charset or a specific font?
23:50 < Guyuttee> It is possible in gedit to switch input methode and have several co-existing in the same document
23:51 < Guyuttee> like here: http://im-classgreek.sourceforge.net/

00:24 < mwilson> How to use that in an abbreviation?

00:24 < mwilson> I have this:
00:24 < mwilson> :iab <new>  <C-R>\" Marc Wilson (msw@cox.net)<CR>" $Date$
00:24 < mwilson> Which inserts an attribution.
00:25 < deryni> thanks strull
00:25 < mwilson> I want it to prefix that with another line that has the filename.
00:25 < mwilson> So I'd get:
00:25 < mwilson> " filename
00:25 < mwilson> " my name
00:25 < mwilson> " the date
00:26 < strull> mm, what is this <new> supposed to do?, never seen this
00:26 < mwilson> It's an insert mode abbreviation.
00:27 < strull> that's :iab, but what is <new>? is this a key on your keyboard ?
00:27 < mwilson> You go into insert mode, you type the characters "<new>", it ctrl-r's it to undo it, then inserts what follows.
00:28 < strull> ahh, I see, it's a 5-letter abbr.
00:28 < mwilson> It's a substitution.
00:28 < mwilson> right
00:28 < strull> ok then, get your filename with

14:52 < Jerub> hendry: how do you mean?
14:52 < Jerub> hendry: is it autoindenting horribly? or do you mean trailing whitespace on lines?
14:53 < Jerub> if its autoindenting horribly, use :set paste

14:57 < Jerub> nixman_: thats up to what your settings are.
14:58 < Jerub> default settings will make you save before you remove a buffer from view (unless that buffer is already open in another window)
14:58 < nixman_> jerub: thanks
14:58 < hendry> Jerub: mostly trailing. but everywhere
14:58 < hendry> maybe i should do it with a regexp
14:59 < hendry> :%s/\s*$//
14:59 < Jerub> hendry: :%s/ \+$//
15:00 < Jerub> you want \+, otherwise it'll match every line :)
15:03 < nixman_> jerub: bd closes the window even if i have another buffer in the list
15:03 < Jerub> bd closes the window?
15:03 < Jerub> interesting.
15:03 < Jerub> maybe you want :bn or something.
15:06 < nixman_> that will take me to next .. i was hoping for something that will close the current buffer and take me to next buffer. This maybe my first script :-)
15:06 < Jerub> *shrug*
15:06 < Jerub> I think you might be solving your problem in the wrong way.
15:07 < Jerub> what are you trying to do?
15:07 < hendry> thanks Jerub 
15:09 < nixman_> i have multiple buffers open. I usually cycle between ~6 buffers.however when i am done with a buffer i want to delete it. But in WManager it closes the window and i have to open the next buffer from the buffer list.
15:10 < nixman_> In usual ide. If i close a buffer it just does not close the editing area even after the last buffer !
15:10 < Jerub> nixman_: you can use a combination of 'go to the next buffer' 'delete the buffer I was just on'.
15:10 < Jerub> :bn then :bd1
15:10 < Jerub> where '1' is the number of the buffer.
15:12 < nixman_> can i just put that in my rc ?
15:13 < nixman_> if there is no buffer 1 what happens ?
15:13 -!- crz|unhappy [~crz@pc36.host33.starman.ee] has joined #vim
15:14 < Jerub> well, you can just figure out what the current buffer is, then use that number in your script

21:29 < Zalamander> hendry /.
21:29 < Zalamander> (in ex mode, I guess it's called)
21:31 < ThunderChicken> ex mode is :-prefixed things, aren't they?
21:31 < Zalamander> I thought it referred to command mode, as opposed to insert mode
21:31 < ThunderChicken>  /^.
21:32 < Zalamander> so that instead of inserting "/.", it actually "searched for the next character. 
21:32 < ThunderChicken> Yes, that would be command mode.
21:32 -!- Kurt [~weberk@enad130pc13.ics.purdue.edu] has joined #vim
21:32 < ThunderChicken> But ex-commands / ex-mode is the stuff you get at with :, no?
21:32 < Zalamander> if you say so :-)
21:33 < ThunderChicken> hendry: ^ means "start of line" when it comes first, and $ means "end of line" when it comes last.
21:33 < Zalamander> . doesn't match newlines apparently anyway
21:33 < ThunderChicken> hendry: so "/^." says "search until you find <start of line><any character>"
21:33 < ThunderChicken> Zalamander: correct.
21:33 < Zalamander> so /. matches the next non-empty line
21:33 < ThunderChicken> . matches [^\n], IIRC.

22:52 < p0g> neither did the second :)
22:53 < qizwiz> backspacing over words in normal mode deletes them. I'd rather it act more like an arrow key in normal mode
22:53 < diz> maybe if you say "insert mode" and "edit mode" we could have a clue
22:53 < qizwiz> normal mode == command mode, right?
22:53 < hendry> I see that some latin encoded files opened in utf-8 mode results in funny chars. vim is not converting them to unicode? or vim just doesn't know that chars are?
22:54 < diz> and it works fine in cygwin for me.. exactly as it works in linux.
22:54 < rjbs> wtf is edit mode?
22:54 < diz> rjbs: standard vi term.
22:54 < diz> maybe vim calls it command mode
22:54 < rjbs> Not in Vim, at least.
22:55 < rjbs> qizwiz: normal mode and command mode refer to the same more.
22:55 < rjbs> mode
22:55 < diz> command mode is probably more correct.
22:55 < rjbs> It's more descriptive, at least.
22:55  * rjbs likes "the mode that beeps."

13:40 < hendry> my cursor keys don't seem to work in vim with uxterm. Any quick suggestions?
13:42 < cerv> use h j k l
13:42 < ipkiss> and/or map your cursor keys to hjkl
13:42 < Heptite> hendry: Make sure your $TERM is properly set.
13:42 < Heptite> hendry: Also make sure you're not in compatible mode, ":set nocompatible".
13:43 < hendry> my term is screen
13:43 < Heptite> Well, your $TERM before you start screen, then. And if you're not using screen, your $TERM should not be screen.
13:44 < cerv> hendy: do you have termcapinfo or terminfo or termcap settings in your .screenrc?
13:45 < cerv> hendry: obviously I am not that good in name spelling
13:46 < hendry> I just restarted my term
13:46 < hendry> it must of got f00ked somewhere somehow
13:46 < hendry> very frustrating
