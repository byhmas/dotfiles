18:28 < hendry> hi
18:29  * hendry is at home
18:30 < sam-mal> Whoa
18:30 < sam-mal> Dude
18:30 < hendry> ?
18:30 < sam-mal> I've been like pondering this multpile schema thing
18:30 < sam-mal> multiple even
18:30 < sam-mal> and it seems to be good good
18:30 < hendry> great =)
18:30 < sam-mal> if some assumptions I made are correct
18:31 < sam-mal> here's what I got
18:31 < sam-mal> Lasses assumptionlist: 1.Schemas is just a collection of text 
18:31 < sam-mal> 2. Schema textfields can contain other schemas
18:32 < hendry> s/text/xml ?
18:32 < sam-mal> no not really
18:32 < sam-mal> like
18:32 < sam-mal> it's really difficult w/out paper but..
18:32 < sam-mal> I'm gonna draw this shite on a notepad and paste here
18:32 < sam-mal> wait a sec
18:33 < hendry> http://www.w3.org/RDF/icons/rdf_powered_button.32
18:35 < hendry> could you please give me the URL for twiki? I have some updates...
18:35 < sam-mal> This is what I thought'd be a good class structure
18:35 < sam-mal> FileReader => Schema -*> SchemaTextfield
18:35 < sam-mal> 				|*->Schema 
18:35 < sam-mal> 				| -- soforth..
18:35 < sam-mal> Schema would be a class that implements SchemaTextField and MutableTreeNode,
18:35 < sam-mal> where SchemaTextField would mean one could ask RDFRenderContents() : String;
18:35 < sam-mal> So if I got a Schema of something, calling the schema instances RDFRenderContext-method
18:35 < sam-mal> would return a String representation of the contents of that schema (going through
18:35 < sam-mal> all the SchemaTextFields calling their RDFRenderContents()
18:35 < sam-mal> http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~msisalmi/twiki/bin/view/Digimon/WebHome
18:36 < sam-mal> and so the schema textfields could hold either just a simple String or another Schema
18:36 < sam-mal> so the RDFRenderContents would be a recursive method
18:36 < sam-mal> going through the tree in a simple manner
18:37 < sam-mal> and the parser would instantiate the Schema classes according to the schema... 
18:38 < sam-mal> like if Schema was Dublin Core, it'd instantiate a new Schema and add new SchemaTextField("Author",RenderingInformation in some format);
18:38 < sam-mal> Rendering information could be just header and footer tags
18:38 < hendry> Sounds good
18:38 < sam-mal> does it make sense? good.
18:38 < hendry> I think so
18:39 < hendry>         <img:polypath>M511 72 L511 72L494 51 L480 51 L466 61 L461 66 L458 75 L456 82 L459 86 L459 90 L471 90 L483 87 L490 86 L499 82 L508 77 z L511 72  z</img:polypath>
18:39 < hendry>         <foaf:regionDepicts>
18:39 < hendry>           <wn:Hat/>
18:39 < hendry>         </foaf:regionDepicts>
18:39 < hendry>       </img:Polygon>
18:39 < sam-mal> so if the FileWrite would call the Image:s main schemas RDFRenderContents it'd automatically call the subnodes render method and eventually return a string preseentation of the shite
18:39 < hendry>       <img:Polygon>
18:39 < hendry>         <img:polypath>M511 72 L511 72L494 51 L480 51 L466 61 L461 66 L458 75 L456 82 L459 86 L459 90 L471 90 L483 87 L490 86 L499 82 L508 77 z L511 72  z</img:polypath>
18:39 < hendry>         <foaf:regionDepicts>
18:39 < hendry>           <wn:Hat/>
18:39 < hendry>         </foaf:regionDepicts>
18:39 < hendry>       </img:Polygon>
18:39 < hendry> that looks ugly
18:40 < hendry> inside img:Polygon is some other stuff. polypath, foaf->wn
18:40 < sam-mal> Hold on, I got a screenshot
18:40 < hendry> goodie
18:41 < sam-mal> awfully stuck computer
18:41 < sam-mal> shouldn't use anything this old
18:41 < sam-mal> www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ltoimela/screenshot.jpg
18:42 < sam-mal> this is just the first tests with JTree
18:42 < sam-mal> but it seems quite ok now that I got the basics sorted
18:43 < sam-mal> I can have icons next to the leafs or nodes or what ever
18:43 < hendry> ok
18:43 < sam-mal> not the prettiest UI ever
18:43 < sam-mal> but has the JTree :)
18:44 < hendry> DC isn't a 'folder' (like annotations or picture1)
18:44 < sam-mal> it isn't?
18:44 < sam-mal> it's supposed to be
18:44 < sam-mal> schemas are "folders"
18:44 < sam-mal> it automatically sets stuff as "folder-looking" if it's got leafs
18:44 < sam-mal> only leafs are rendered as leafs
18:44 < sam-mal> :)
18:44 < hendry> I envisioned folders to be groups of schemas
18:45 < sam-mal> you could have own custom renderer though
18:45 < sam-mal> but it's only like the look of the stuff
18:45 < sam-mal> it doesn't affect it that much
18:45 < sam-mal> each image is a collection of schemas, each schema is collection of schema-textfields
18:45 < sam-mal> and schema textfields are either textfields or another schema
18:46 < sam-mal> Just wondering how to do that Schema.RDFRenderText
18:47 < sam-mal> I mean like in PolyPAth.. well
18:47 < sam-mal> or in foaf, the contents of the  <foaf:regionDepicts> is  <wn:Hat/> .. how does the user know it's writing the stuff right

18:48 < sam-mal> if user can write into foaf:regionDepicts field something like <wn:asdifakoÅÖÄÖÅ/> isn't it broken XML?=
18:48 < hendry> Notice that png:Image
18:48 < hendry> and how dc:type comes in there
18:48 < hendry> and then carries on png:image-*
18:48 < hendry> can that be done with the UI ?
18:48 < sam-mal> dunno
18:49 < sam-mal> this is getting too complicated :)
18:49 < sam-mal> the parser is gonna be a bitch to code
18:49 < hendry> indeed
18:49 < sam-mal> I'm glad we sorta agreed it's your territory
18:49 < sam-mal> :)
18:49 < hendry> I was looking an xml editor classes for java
18:50 < hendry> well nevermind that
18:50 < hendry> i hope jena is up to the task
18:50 < sam-mal> yeah
18:50 < sam-mal> I haven't that much looked into Jena
18:50 < hendry> we need to do this probably like DOM
18:50 < sam-mal> yeps
18:50 < hendry> err...
18:50 < hendry> hmmmwmmm... I am going to finish editing the RA and take a break :)
18:51 < hendry> tomorrow
18:51 < hendry> i will think about that stuff
18:53 < sam-mal> oh ok
18:53 < sam-mal> I'll try to fix something working for tomorrow
18:53 < sam-mal> prolly can't
18:53 < sam-mal> but it'd be good. so I know if this approach is too complex for us to develope in this timeframe
18:55 < hendry> i think the tree is the best/only way. :)
18:58 < sam-mal> yeah guess so
18:58 < sam-mal> have you btw. heard of this band ("") called "the streets"?
19:07 < sam-mal> once bitten, for ever smitten
19:13 < hendry> yes yes i have their album. very good
19:13 < sam-mal> ok
19:14 < sam-mal> just listening to the original pirate material stuff..
19:14 < hendry> stay positive
19:15 < sam-mal> yeps.
19:15 < sam-mal> I have to confess, I'm not awfully eager to bloat this project of ours
19:16 < sam-mal> like I got tons of other shite to do, though I'm not saying we should just do it the crappiest easiest way possible
19:16 < sam-mal> this tree-stuff is really cool
19:16 < sam-mal> but like you said, this'd be some sort of universal XML-thing-a-magic
19:17 < sam-mal> and those things seem to have bit more than the approximated 3kloc :)
19:17 < hendry> just hope we show a good concept at least
19:17 < hendry> because i don't think i have seen it anywhere else :)
19:18 < sam-mal> true true
19:18 < sam-mal> if we got more time + credits out of this, we could make this great
19:19 < sam-mal> about those fields, should there be _any_ fields, where user would have to write xml?
19:19 < sam-mal> or should all fields be like about inputting normal text
19:20 < hendry> it is best we do not show any xml 
19:20 < hendry> yes normal text
19:22 < sam-mal> cause if we'd have any field user should have to input xml we should need to verify it and blah blah
19:22 < sam-mal> internet is broken
19:22 < sam-mal> bugger
19:23 < sam-mal> all so slow, must be the sonera main network

17:49 < mon-go> mr. womanizer...
17:49 <@hendry> yea...
17:49 < mon-go> is it ok I tell this to my gf if she promises not to tell it forward?
17:49 -!- mode/#imarea [+o mon-go] by hendry
17:50 -!- mon-go changed the topic of #imarea to: Planning Document deadline next thursday...
17:50 <@hendry> I don't know. She is a nice girl and all, but I am not up for relasonships
17:50 <@hendry> lets not think about it
17:50 <@mon-go> *thinking*
17:50 <@mon-go> ok
17:53 <@mon-go> it's gonna be a looong meeting tomorrow
17:54 <@hendry> the diagrams out of pressman suck
17:54 <@mon-go> surprisingly
17:54 <@hendry> where are those eclipse generated diagrams go? can't they go in this doc ?
17:54 <@mon-go> I don't personally rate pressman very high, even though he (and the book of his) might be some sort of mr. standard of sw dev
17:54 <@mon-go> well the eclipse diagrams are good good, and we gonna put them prolly here
17:55 <@mon-go> they are done with reverse-engineering
17:55 <@hendry> reverse-engineering?
17:55 <@mon-go> so atleast the final class diagrams should be done with it IMHO..
17:55 <@mon-go> yeah
17:55 <@hendry> Hmm, can you give me some and I can get them in there?
17:55 <@mon-go> it analyses the already-made java-code and generates the UML class diagram
17:55 <@mon-go> well yeah I can I guess
17:55 <@mon-go> but it's just an instance of this current phase of the project
17:55 <@mon-go> hold on
17:56 <@mon-go> booting up eclipse
17:58 <@mon-go> all these fucking conflicts in synchronization
17:58 <@mon-go> I still don't know how to get stuff from earlier versions to new version
17:59 <@mon-go> and the stupid cvsWeb stopped working yesterday
18:00 <@mon-go> Ok things are good, I don't have the UML plugin, got a new os installed..
18:00 <@mon-go> hold on
18:01 <@hendry> Is the Reader and Writer one subsystem or two ?
18:01 <@mon-go> ok loading the plugin
18:02 <@mon-go> I hope they are the same
18:02 <@mon-go> I/O
18:02 <@mon-go> or somethi
18:02 <@mon-go> file I/O
18:02 <@hendry> But aren't they substationally different ... to be in different classes?
18:03 <@mon-go> dunno
18:03 <@hendry> Hmmm
18:03 <@mon-go> what I'd add to your picture (fig 2.1) is a GUI
18:03 <@mon-go> around which all shit would go
18:04 <@mon-go> like READER->PARSER->( GUI: TREE,SELECTOR ( IMAGE) ) -> WRITER
18:04 <@mon-go> type of thing
18:06 <@hendry> that's good
18:06 <@hendry> READER->PARSER->( GUI: TREE, SELECTOR->IMAGE) ) -> WRITER
18:06 <@hendry> How about that?
18:07 <@hendry> READER->PARSER->( GUI: TREE, SELECTOR<-IMAGE) ) -> WRITER
18:07 <@mon-go> well good I guess, don't know how you gonna lay it out :D
18:07 <@hendry> Then I am confused about Parser. Isn't the parser encapsulated by the reader/writer
18:07 <@mon-go> have you btw. checked "dot" or what was it called
18:07 <@mon-go> well yeah it sort of is
18:08 <@mon-go> but it's like to make things more describe the dataflow I guess
18:08 <@mon-go> like we don't just have THING->PROGRAM->THING2
18:08 <@mon-go> but I guess it could be like
18:08 <@mon-go> PARSER->GUI(...
18:08 <@mon-go>    |
18:08 <@mon-go>   v
18:09 <@hendry> fuck... hours! when was our last meeting. Thurs?
18:09 <@mon-go> READER
18:09 <@mon-go> yeah
18:09 <@mon-go> did you forgot them hours? aleksi was raving about them in e-mail y-day and today
18:09 <@mon-go> :)
18:10 <@mon-go> eclipse is now doing the UML
18:11 <@hendry> shaft
18:13 <@mon-go> god
18:14 <@mon-go> it can export it in svg
18:14 <@mon-go> and jpg and gif.. but the size of the thing is like one kilometer / side
18:14 <@hendry> eps?
18:18 <@mon-go> njet
18:18 <@mon-go> but you can do gif2eps
18:18 <@mon-go> but problem is the horrible layout
18:18 <@mon-go> I try to fix it so that you can print it to fit one medium sized warehouse wall
18:18 <@hendry> you have 20 mins to fix it
18:18 <@hendry> :)
18:23 <@mon-go> haha
18:23 <@mon-go> www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ltoimela/test.jpg
18:23 <@mon-go> :D
18:23 <@mon-go> there
18:24 <@mon-go> "pretty picture"
18:24 <@hendry> what is this? class diagram?
18:24 <@mon-go> yes I think so
18:26 <@mon-go> you can load eclipse and open the imarea.ucd file
18:26 <@mon-go> then you can drag the classes where ever you want to
18:26 <@mon-go> and then right click->export->...
18:27 <@hendry> should it be in this doc btw?
18:27 <@hendry> I think it has to in the appendix
18:27 <@mon-go> I think it needs to be
18:28 <@mon-go> like so that it's done by only taking certain classes into game that form a subsystem
18:28 <@mon-go> and use those (hopefully more clear) small partial classdiagrams with each subsystem?
18:29 <@mon-go> btw. have to ask, did you tell reetta y-day that you are terrified and you don't know what to do but not much into this bf/gf commitment stuff?
18:29 <@hendry> no. of course not. that would be sensible.
18:29 <@mon-go> yeah.
18:30 <@mon-go> but you gonna tell her sooner or later.. hmm
18:30 <@mon-go> awkward one might say
18:31  * hendry tries to print .eps of the diagram
18:31 <@mon-go> did you open the .umc or what was it?
18:31 <@mon-go> or just the jpeg I have?
18:32 <@mon-go> this big picture in my www page is totally of no use
18:32 <@hendry> I converted the jpeg
18:34 <@mon-go> you at the dept?
18:34 <@hendry> yes
18:34 <@hendry> It prints surprisingly well btw
18:34 <@hendry> I can make out the text
18:34 <@mon-go> I was asking you for lunch around 13 today but you were away btw...
18:38 <@hendry> I was in town
18:39 <@mon-go> smooth operating and keeping it real? :D
18:40 <@hendry> I met a girl in town. But I amazingly didn't hand over the magic card. :)
18:40 <@hendry> Its been amazingly easy lately
18:40 <@mon-go> humm
18:40 <@hendry> the weather I guess
18:40 <@mon-go> try to be subtle with reetta
18:40 <@mon-go> if that's the word
18:43 <@hendry> http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~msisalmi/twiki/pub/Digimon/PlanningDocument/PlanningDocument_04082003.pdf
18:43 <@hendry> I need to go out to look at the place
18:44 <@mon-go> oh ok
18:44 <@mon-go> see you tomorrow
