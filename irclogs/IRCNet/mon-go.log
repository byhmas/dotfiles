16:23 <hendry> hi
16:23 <mon-go> Hi
16:23 <mon-go> Just got svg sort of working
16:23 <mon-go> nested shite don't work, ie. elements in groups
16:24 <mon-go> the recursive algorithm would be simple, but just don't get it working so restorted to an even simpler one
16:24 <mon-go> so wassup K?
16:24 <hendry> Ah good. I was about to say it is beyond my skillset to get java running and classpath blah. 
16:24 <hendry> I wanted you to encourage you to make a package or something 
16:24 <hendry> Or will it just work now ? :)
16:24 <mon-go> you need batik libraries
16:24 <mon-go> Batik batik
16:24 <hendry> ok ok 
16:25 <hendry> Is it worth running and taking screenshots at this point?
16:25 <mon-go> Well I guess so
16:25 <mon-go> Just you need to have a nice RDF to load
16:25 <hendry> Is classpath a bash env var?
16:26 <hendry> sweet jesus. maybe i'll just wait for tomorrow
16:27 <mon-go> if you use eclipse you don't have to poke the classpath by hand
16:27 <mon-go> I think I'll come to the dept today
16:27 <mon-go> I mean I think I'll go there now
16:27 <hendry> did you look at my new round of crappy pictures? I think you need to quickly tell me what classes are inherentiddd

16:28 <mon-go> How come?
16:28 <mon-go> you are there till 7?
16:28 <hendry> I will sign my contract down in Kallio at 7pm =)
16:29 <mon-go> Oh..
16:29 <mon-go> the system overview is nice, those little things there
16:29 <mon-go> servers or blocks or legos or whatnot...
16:30 <hendry> Components. We can discuss when you are here. It is quicker
16:30 <mon-go> Ok, I check the laundry situation. they should be abt. finished, if they're not I'll leave them rolling and come
16:30 <mon-go> see you
16:31 <mon-go> "random I am, never give a damn.." :)
