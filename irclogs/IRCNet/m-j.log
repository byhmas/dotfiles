15:33 -!- Irssi: Starting query in IRCNet with M-J
15:33 <M-J> do you honestly think that I would link a page with FU HOAS, FU JIPPII & FU SONERA !!! in it?
15:34 <M-J> that's not my oppinion of informative
15:36 <hendry> They should be attacked. 
15:37 <M-J> oh really?
15:37 <hendry> Do you have any idea have bad their service is? Has been ? And continues to be?
15:38 <hendry> My HOASNET site receives a better rank than Sonera's own with google, so figure that out.
15:38 <M-J> I don't always like hoasnet and the way sonera is working but how is your page gonna help anything?
15:38 <M-J> well sure there are good instructions for linux users
15:38 <hendry> My page tells people of outages, changes in their setup, and how to configure HOASNET for the linux platform
15:39 <hendry> Are there are many outages
15:39 <hendry> And there has been changes to their service
15:39 <hendry> Information they simply do not provide
15:40 <M-J> but still I dont find your pages appropriate
15:40 <hendry> It doesn't matter. I don't care what you think. People still find my page through google.
15:40 <M-J> you should separate instructions and insults, then it would be ok..
15:41 <hendry> They deserve the insults.
15:41 <hendry> How can I company with so many customers be some stupid?
15:41 <M-J> so why should we link it when people find it by google
15:41 <M-J> I don't know
15:41 <hendry> because I wasted my time to try make your page more informative??
15:42 <M-J> [M-J] do you honestly think that I would link a page with FU HOAS, FU JIPPII & FU SONERA !!! in it?
15:42 <M-J> [M-J] that's not my oppinion of informative
15:42 <hendry> alright then. bye.
15:42 <M-J> FU:s aren't informative
