20:07 <@Kam> i like the upgrades
20:07 <@GlimmerMan> upgrade that lets em do roar while in bear form and faerie fire with in crow form
20:07 <@Kam> so u can cast fairire fire while in flying =)
20:07 <@GlimmerMan> long over due tbh
20:08 <@GlimmerMan> mebbe we see some different NE strats now
20:08 <@Kam> lots of new upgrades are cool
20:08 <@Kam> ancients can attack while rooted
20:08 <@GlimmerMan> undead have 'moonwells' :)
20:08 <@Kam> isnt that "manawells"?
20:08 <@Kam> my
20:08 <@Kam> NE can upgrade moonwells
20:08 <@Kam> sweet
20:09 <@GlimmerMan> the upgrade likily takes em back to what they were b4 the nerfing
20:09 <@Kam> there should be more variety in what ppl do in the expansion aswell
20:09 <@GlimmerMan> meat wagon upgrade sounds good
20:09 <@Kam> are they getting rid of its old function>?
20:09 <@GlimmerMan> automatically generates corpses
20:09 <@Kam> cos no one ever uses that 
20:10 <@GlimmerMan> over time it fills up with corpses without u having to pick em up
20:10 <@Kam> i really want to see some ppl using them
20:10 <@Kam> i always used to try
20:10 <@Kam> necros and DK, with some carts of corpses
20:10 <@GlimmerMan> i tired once mass wagons with corpses and skellies
20:10 <@GlimmerMan> i was owned
20:10 <@GlimmerMan> long time ago anyway
20:10 <@Kam> get skelton mages now
20:11 <@GlimmerMan> i wanna know if the mages will have a spell
20:11 <@Kam> they might just be ranged skeletons essentially
20:11 <@Kam> who knows
20:11 <@GlimmerMan> what i did notice is the mages have 230 health
20:11 <@GlimmerMan> meaning a single dispell won;t kill them
20:11 <@Kam> burrow sounds fun =)
20:11 <@Kam> hmm
20:11 <@GlimmerMan> none of those mirrors on that page r working :(
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> yer burrow is gonna rock
20:12 <@Kam> what if someone builds a building on a burrowed thing ?
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> i expect it won;t let u
20:12 <@Xiven> well in SC you couldn't
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> it'll show a red square where the unit is
20:12 <@Kam> well
20:12 <@Kam> i guess so
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> like if u try to build on a shade, or ward etc
20:12 <@Kam> but it kind of gives it away =)
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> true
20:12 <@Kam> u can build on a ward
20:12 <@GlimmerMan> i had a mean thought with the new orc hero
20:13 <@GlimmerMan> u could catapult a nice clearing in the trees near enemy base
20:13 <@GlimmerMan> zep him in
20:13 <@GlimmerMan> then use his ult
20:13 <@GlimmerMan> with ur army attacking from the front
20:13 <@Kam> just use his polymorph and make him a sheep =)
20:13 <@Kam> if u are against orc
20:14 <@Kam> they can do that =)
20:14 <@GlimmerMan> i hope all positive buffs dispell when he casts his ultimate
20:14 <@Kam> or can stormbolt him
20:14 <@GlimmerMan> it would suck if he could use an invul potion
20:14 <@Kam> heh
20:15 <@Kam> and u can sell items now
20:15 <@Kam> Marketplace - A store for purchasing goods. As creeps are killed, whatever items they drop will simultaneously stock this store.
20:15 <@Kam> my
20:15 <@Kam> that sounds scary
20:15 <@GlimmerMan> yer :/
20:15 <@GlimmerMan> i'll buy 6 infernal stones plz!
20:15 <@Kam> tombs of experience =)
20:15 <@GlimmerMan> u hear that units have inventory now too?
20:15 <@Kam> yeah
20:15 <@GlimmerMan> they each have 2 slots
20:15 <@Kam> that sucks
20:16 <@Kam> i dont like that at all
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> i wonder what happends to the items if they get killed
20:16 <@Kam> if they could use them it would be ok
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> they can;t use the items
20:16 <@Kam> but they cant
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> they can only carry them
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> well
20:16 <@Kam> at last they add /r !
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> u could use them to carry items u never gonn use
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> at last 
20:16 <@GlimmerMan> but what if 2 ppl /w u?
20:17 <@GlimmerMan> who will the /r go to?
20:17 <@Kam> well
20:17 <@Kam> that last person
20:17 <@Kam> u /w
20:17 <@Kam> the handicap options are cool aswell
20:18 <@GlimmerMan> i don't think ne1 will use the handicap
20:19 <@Kam> well it means we could play hixie and almost be fair
20:19 <@GlimmerMan> hehe
20:19 <@Xiven> only on max handicap
20:19 <@GlimmerMan> which d/l link did u use btw?

20:25 < Kamakaze> but this is just the beta
20:25 <@ChocoJon> ok
20:25 <@ChocoJon> what does it add?
20:25 < Kamakaze> quite alot...
20:25 < Kamakaze> http://skull.gamersrus.com/expansionchanges.txt
20:25 < Kamakaze> theres a vague list
20:25 <@ChocoJon> ty
20:26 < Kamakaze> they are still adding a few more things i think

20:29 < Kamakaze> dryads still do piercing damage?
20:29 <@GlimmerMan> yes
20:29 <@GlimmerMan> says so in the file i have
20:29 < Kamakaze> if they didnt dryads vs dryads would be very silly
20:30 < Kamakaze> if they did magic damage

20:34 <@GlimmerMan> u still need ur wc3 cd in for the beta
20:34 < Kamakaze> probably
20:34 <@GlimmerMan> i just tried :)
20:34 < Kamakaze> it rarely leaves my drive 
20:34 <@GlimmerMan> bah bastards
20:34 <@GlimmerMan> thye left it as the old main screen
20:35 <@GlimmerMan> i wanted to see the new one :(
20:35 < Kamakaze> u ran the patch?
20:35 <@GlimmerMan> i ran the official installer with the generated key
20:35 < Kamakaze> what about the patch?
20:35 < Kamakaze> that has actual game stuff in it
20:35 <@GlimmerMan> and u can;t even go into options :/
20:35 < Kamakaze> that installer really doesnt do much
20:35 <@GlimmerMan> 800*600 sux
20:35 <@GlimmerMan> i only got 75% of the 60mb one
20:36 <@GlimmerMan> i hope it sorts those things
20:36 < Kamakaze> the installer is just something to let u get the update
20:36 < Kamakaze> the expansion is just a larger than normal patch =)
20:36 <@GlimmerMan> yer guess so

20:38 <@GlimmerMan> well it makes sense
20:38 <@GlimmerMan> no unit is ready for the attack
20:38 <@GlimmerMan> so they would be more vulnerable to a 'critical' strike
20:39 <@GlimmerMan> will suck with level 3 wind walk for the other person
20:39 <@GlimmerMan> unless u get a gem ;)
20:39 < Kamakaze> if someone is using windwalk and him
20:39 < Kamakaze> i ALWAYS get a gem
20:39 < Kamakaze> are ethereal units invisible?
20:40 <@GlimmerMan> no
20:40 <@GlimmerMan> they appear to all as an invisible unit on ur team would
20:40 <@GlimmerMan> only magic can hurt them 
20:40 <@GlimmerMan> so only spells and magic damage units can touch them
20:41 <@GlimmerMan> o u slag :/
20:41 < Kamakaze> but they cant attack
20:41 <@GlimmerMan> 94%
20:41 < Kamakaze> they can only cast spells
20:41 <@GlimmerMan> "service un availible try later"
20:41 <@GlimmerMan> well tbh u seen the new spell caster stats?
20:42 < Kamakaze> well i still have an hour and 17 minutes to go
20:42 <@GlimmerMan> 9 damage max for necros for example
20:42 <@GlimmerMan> glad it supports resume
20:42 <@GlimmerMan> 100% :)

21:37 < Kam> it looks like the demon hunter
21:39 < Kam> tha black sphinx looks totally crap
21:40 <@GlimmerMan> yes they r spirit of veng
21:40 <@GlimmerMan> 6 different levels of it
21:40 <@GlimmerMan> thats the statue
21:40 <@GlimmerMan> not the sphinx form
21:41 <@GlimmerMan> as is always with the editer , the flying one looks like the building
21:41 <@GlimmerMan> but it will look proper in the game
21:42 < Kam> what is the flying one ?
21:42 < Kam> is it in that picture?
21:42 <@GlimmerMan> thats the sphinx
21:42 <@GlimmerMan> but likew i said it don;t show proper
21:42 <@GlimmerMan> liek if u select demon form in the editer it looks like a normal demon hunter
21:42 <@GlimmerMan> till u go into the game
21:43 < Kam> i hate big heros
21:43 < Kam> the tauren hero is great but he has realy issues with pathing and an army
21:44 <@GlimmerMan> yer bigger units get forced to the back
21:44 <@GlimmerMan> which sux for fornt line fighters
21:46 < Kam> oh yes
21:46 < Kam> that page
21:46 < Kam> had a no cd crack for frozen throne btw

21:47 < Kam> well
21:47 < Kam> on my hard drive
21:48 < Kam> so i can still play proper wc3
21:48 <@GlimmerMan> u need to reinstall it after putting the beta on
21:48 <@GlimmerMan> then they both work 
21:48 < Kam> mine both work fine
21:49 <@GlimmerMan> the beta overwrites wc3 files
21:49 < Kam> i just installed tft
21:49 < Kam> no it doesnt
21:49 <@GlimmerMan> blizzard even say u gotta reinstall
21:49 < Kam> unless it knew where i copied it to
21:50 < Kam> just copy your game dir to another dir, then install tft
21:50 < Kam> and u have both
21:50 <@GlimmerMan> or run the installer again and u have both in on folder
21:50 <@GlimmerMan> on = one
21:51 < Kam> blizzard says to install them to different folders doesnt it?
21:51 <@GlimmerMan> i have them in the same one
21:51 <@GlimmerMan> i merged the folders
21:51 <@GlimmerMan> it still works
21:52 < Kam> well

23:05 <@GlimmerMan> look at the items
23:05 <@GlimmerMan> there r 2 lightning orbs
23:07 <@GlimmerMan> some items i wanna try
23:07 < Kam> the orb of lightning
23:07 <@GlimmerMan> vampiric potion sounds interesting
23:07 < Kam> is the old one
23:07 < Kam> if u sort by level
23:07 < Kam> level 0 things usually are single player or not in multiplayer things
23:08 < Kam> ooh a scroll of speed
23:09 < Kam> potion of less invulnerability
23:09 < Kam> what is that supposed to mean
23:10 <@GlimmerMan> shorter duration?
23:10 < Kam> i guess so
23:10 <@GlimmerMan> potion of clarity?
23:10 < Kam> mana
23:10 < Kam> regen
23:10 < Kam> over time
23:10 < Kam> i think
23:10 <@GlimmerMan> hmmm
23:10 <@GlimmerMan> potion of divinity looks interesting
23:10 <@GlimmerMan> temp divine armour?
23:10 < Kam> potion of omniscience is see the whole map for 30 seconds
23:11 <@GlimmerMan> which is better than invulnerable since units can still attack u
23:11 <@GlimmerMan> and won't just run away like if u were invul
23:12 <@GlimmerMan> hmmm
23:12 <@GlimmerMan> look at new level 0 items sneek peak at campaign?
23:12 < Kam> i expect so
23:12 <@GlimmerMan> or
23:12  * Kam is watching the animations of the new heroes ...
23:12 <@GlimmerMan> level 0 could be stuff u can only buy
23:13 < Kam> well level 0 IS stuff from single player
23:13 < Kam> i know that for a fact
23:13 <@GlimmerMan> look at the new level 0 stuff
23:13 <@GlimmerMan> monster lure
23:13 <@GlimmerMan> thats an item that lures creeps in multi
23:13 <@GlimmerMan> its 0
23:14 < Kam> its possible its not in the beta yet or its disabled or its just set to 0
23:14 < Kam> undead flag clearly isnt something u will buy ina shop
23:15 < Kam> can the crypt lord burrow?
23:15 <@GlimmerMan> yes
23:16 < Kam> cos there is an animation of him doing so
23:16 <@GlimmerMan> how u see anims?
23:16 < Kam> u can see it in the little window on the left
23:16 < Kam> select a unit
23:16 < Kam> then u can cycle thru the anims with the arrow buttons

18:27 <@Xiven> well done
18:32 <@draq> Xiven: your host is dreamhost right?
18:32 <@Xiven> correct
18:32 <@draq> I am getting a crazy amount of traffic from bots on my pages
18:33 <@draq> I think I will have to exclude all but google somehow
18:33 <@Xiven> uh-huh
18:33 <@draq> isn't your bandwidth bill something?
18:33 <@draq> how much do you pay?
18:33 <@Xiven> http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/02/26/how_to_block_spambots_ban_spybots_and_tell_unwanted_robots_to_go_to_hell.html
18:33 <@draq> yeah i saw that too
18:33 <@Xiven> i'm not sure myself
18:33 <@Xiven> hixie does the paying
18:33 <@draq> because i use my shell quite heavily
18:34 <@draq> not if i wanted a similar service to my CS dept.
18:34 <@Xiven> unless we go over bandwidth quota i don't think we have to pay any extra
18:34 <@draq> what the hell am i to pay?
18:34 <@draq> do you have a dedicated machine then?
18:34 <@Xiven> no
18:34 <@draq> so how is Hixie taking care of everything? on a managed host to yourselves?
18:35 <@Xiven> something like that

23:42 <@NoVisAnima> urm
23:42  * NoVisAnima wheels out his only excuse
23:43 <@NoVisAnima> ahem
23:43 <@NoVisAnima> it seemed like a good idea at the time
23:43 <@ChocoJon> sounded kinda like a grenade
23:44 <@ChocoJon> where do people generally shop for computer bits?
23:44 <@NoVisAnima> dont ask me, i dunno
23:44 <@Kam> scan
23:44 <@Kam> dabs
23:44 <@Kam> umm
23:44 <@Kam> umm isnt one
23:44 <@GwieF> you have grenades that make 'wiggle wiggles' sounds?
23:44 <@Kam> they do kind of wiggle wiggle
23:44 <@Kam> after they rest on the ground
23:45 <@draq> ChocoJon: dabs.com
23:45 <@Kam> 2 big clunks then settles on the ground with a couple of wiggles
23:45 <@ChocoJon> GwieF: they are weighted on the bases to wiggle and instill fear in the few seconds before they explode
23:45 <@draq> I think I will be buying another 256 for ye old mem
23:45 <@ChocoJon> oops, did I say too much?
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> yes you did
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> i'll put it this way
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> that ran though my mind and the only way i could get it out was by writting it down
23:46 <@NoVisAnima> soz to anyone who was mildly effected
23:46 <@NoVisAnima> ~:/
23:46  * GwieF still isn't convinced about the wiggle wiggle
23:47 <@draq> anyone tried splinter cell thingie?
23:47 <@GwieF> I just bought it
23:47 <@GwieF> but I don't think it works on the graphics card I have :)
23:47 <@GwieF> old gf2 mx ... might finally be time to upgrade :)
23:48 <@draq> GwieF: Is it multiplayer?
23:48 <@GwieF> no idea at all
23:48 <@Kam> no it isnt
23:48 <@GwieF> was impulse buy I've never even seen it :)
23:48 <@draq> what are good HDs atm?
23:48 <@GwieF> 120GB

23:50 <@GwieF> ah

23:50 <@ChocoJon> I'd recommend getting a 8MB cacge one - it does improve transfer rates
23:50 <@Kam> ok
23:50 <@Kam> maybe its 11
23:51 <@GwieF> I've had a maxtor die when I knocked my PC over so I'm sticking to those 2 ^ as there like the only HD's that havn't died on me left

13:47 <@draq> and load ?
13:47 <@Kam> but the server load can be quite high
13:47 <@draq> assumed so
13:47 <@Kam> although the ticker usually only takes 2-3 seconds
13:47 <@draq> how many hits do you get on your blog btw? i got about 2000 is 3 weeks :)
13:49 <@Kam> i have had 689 in a month or something like that
13:49 <@draq> Hixie: how much do you get?
13:49 <@draq> I am impressed by Mark Pilg's stats. Crazy
13:49 <@Kam> he gets about 2000 a day
13:55 <@draq> http://www.lasersquadnemesis.com/media_screenshots.htm
13:55 <@draq> heard of this ?
13:55 <@Kam> no

01:01 < Krypt0n> yep, cool
01:02 <@NoVisAnima> it's really simple but damn is it dull
01:02 <@NoVisAnima> specially as you really have to test for the same things with each section of the system
01:02 < Krypt0n> i'm concerned that I misunderstand what he wants in the test plan, and that I put it in the VnV plan
01:02 < Krypt0n> ahh well
01:03 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
01:03 < Krypt0n> doesn't really matter, hopefully he will give feedback to us on the first milestones
01:03 <@NoVisAnima> i'm just going to plow on with this and just get it done
01:03 < Krypt0n> so we can go back and fiddle before the final deliverable
01:03 <@NoVisAnima> find out if it was worthwhile later
01:03 <@NoVisAnima> i think the main idea of the first milestone is to make sure no group is slacking around
01:04 <@NoVisAnima> and we are all more or less at the same point
01:04 < Krypt0n> hmm
01:05 < Krypt0n> yeah, I think that's the point too, but I'm not sure that we are all at more or less the same point, I'm sure my group is behind
01:05 < NanakiXII> how come?
01:05 <@NoVisAnima> i think my group is sorta average i suppose
01:07 <@NoVisAnima> oh ffs why cant people get it into their thick skulls that it is an absolute bitch to get ordinary overlay to work over 2 monitors and you need to make use of vmr 9 which *might* be the base of dscaler 5 and not dscaler 4 which is still in beta
01:07 <@NoVisAnima> s/right bitch/imposible
01:08 < NanakiXII> Right i am off to bed
01:08 < NanakiXII> for getting up early tomorrow
01:08 <@NoVisAnima> night night
01:08 < NanakiXII> for doing lots of work

21:10 <@Kamakaze> lo draq
21:10 <@Kamakaze> i guess so
21:10 <@Kamakaze> im a little sort of our of practice
21:11 <@Kamakaze> in that i have been playing the beta
21:11 < Ravenn> hi Kam
21:11 <@Kamakaze> so classic wc3 is a little odd
21:11 < Ravenn> we haven't played either
21:11 <@Kamakaze> yes but this is like anti-practice

21:16 < Ravenn> ok, checked Blizzard: what do you think about it?
21:16 < Ravenn> frozen throne, I mean
21:16 <@Kamakaze> well
21:16 <@Kamakaze> its not balanced
21:17 <@Kamakaze> but i like the new stuff
21:17 <@Kamakaze> cant wait for more neutral heroes
21:17 <@Kamakaze> they havent finished adding and tinkering yet
21:17 <@Kamakaze> lots of things changing
21:17 < Ravenn> are you an official tester?
21:17 <@Kamakaze> lol
21:17 <@Kamakaze> no
21:17 <@Kamakaze> like they would pick someone who isnt a US citizen
21:18 <@Kamakaze> i think they have selected a "token" number of non americans
21:18 < Ravenn> they say they randomly picked the testers.
21:18 <@Kamakaze> they have picked 20k ppl out of 10k
21:18 <@Kamakaze> i mean 100k
21:18 < Ravenn> what'd testing got to do with citizenship?
21:18 <@Kamakaze> so thats 1 in 5 chance of me being picked
21:18 <@Kamakaze> and i know 5 ppl who signed up
21:18 <@Kamakaze> and none of them got in
21:18 < Ravenn> a lot better than wining the lottery :)
21:19 <@draq> Ravenn: ffs, esnbb.org
21:19 <@draq> post-fucking-gres
21:19 < Ravenn> what?
21:19 < Ravenn> the server died
21:19 < Ravenn> restart it
21:20 < Ravenn> was it running on db? maybe they rebooted db for a kernel update?
21:21 <@draq> Ravenn: "It seems another postmaster is already running."
21:21 < Ravenn> anyway, Blizzard is looking for a network administrator  who "Must be experienced in playing computer games" :)
21:21 <@draq> Ravenn: what the fuck is that about?
21:21 < Ravenn> netstat -l --program
21:26 <@draq> damn .pid i bet
21:27 <@draq> ok i restart

21:32 <@draq> Xiven: My fans complain about my current style. I see on your page you can change. But when I return the style choice I made is reset.
21:32 <@Xiven> interesting
21:32 <@Xiven> the cookie is set to expire in 1 year....
21:33 <@Xiven> i didn't know you had fans :)
21:33 <@draq> oh its working now
21:34 <@draq> i should say, *fan*
21:34 <@Xiven> heh
21:34 <@Kam> yes kai
21:34 <@Kam> i dont like your style =) text is too big =)
21:34 <@Kam> i mean xivens blog is set to the old style
21:34 <@Kam> so i dont even know he has changed anything
21:34 <@draq> So, I need a cookie eh?
21:35 <@Kam> my site can do styles
21:35 <@Xiven> well if you want it to remember the choice then probably
21:35 <@Kam> just the style sheets are so out of date
21:36 <@draq> oh fuck
21:36 <@draq> i hate doing styles
21:36 <@draq> as you can see
21:37 <@Xiven> :)
21:37 <@draq> i usually just rip something i like
21:37 <@draq> i like yours xiven :)
21:37 <@Kam> i would like your site if the text was smaller =)
21:37 <@Xiven> uh-oh :)
21:37 <@draq> Kam: the blog or the /u/hendry ?
21:37 <@Kam> just the blog
21:37 <@draq> Kam: ok, I will change that
21:38 <@draq> I have a 19" TFT at work, that it is why they are quite big
21:38 <@Kam> the font is so big everything just looks random
21:38 <@Kam> well
21:38 <@Kam> hmmm
21:38 <@Kam> theres an idea
21:38 <@Kam> aswell as a style sheet choice
21:38 <@Kam> i can provide a font size option
21:39 <@draq> hmmm
21:39 <@Xiven> that's kinda redundant
21:39 <@draq> looks like i have not set font-size in my style sheet
21:39 <@Xiven> is it not?
21:39 <@Kam> no it isnt
21:39 <@draq> just the weight
21:39 <@Kam> i dont want to make a new style sheet for each font size
21:39 <@Xiven> kam: most of us just allow the users to change their own font size using the browser controls that work so well
21:40 <@Kam> mozillas text zoom is fine
21:40 <@Kam> but its only per browser not per site
21:40 <@draq> hmmm, what do you think Kam ?
21:40 <@Kam> hmm
21:41 <@Kam> now the small text blends in with the background more..
21:41 <@Kam> was better bigger i think
21:41 <@draq> font-weight maybe
21:41 <@draq> Kam: ok?
21:41 <@Xiven> the headings are too low down on the right, doesn't look right
21:42 <@draq> hmmm, thats style :)
21:42 <@Kam> yeah the body shouldnt start till the heading has finished
21:42 <@Kam> or at least be slightly above the header..
21:42 <@draq> why is the width of the page gone mental....
21:46 <@draq> url of a debug .css? :)

13:31 <@ChocoJon> plaid with spots?
13:32 < NanakiXII> uh?
13:32 <@ChocoJon> that would be quite ridiculous... ;)
13:33 < NanakiXII> actually i wore my really short skirt before
13:33 < NanakiXII> and i got 3 beeps going down lower bristol road ;D 
13:33 < NanakiXII> but that was for comic relief
13:33 <@ChocoJon> so we're talking almost wide belt then?

13:36 <@ChocoJon> it may be inappropriate then
13:36 <@ChocoJon> but since I don't wear skirts, I'm not one to comment. ;)

19:45 <@ChocoJon> Question:  is active cooling using a fan? Or a Heat sink with something that moves i.e. heatpipe? or what?
19:45 <+Dax> yes to first
19:45 <+Dax> active is when you use energy to remove heat
19:46 <+Dax> ie fan
19:46 <+Dax> or peltier
19:46 <@ChocoJon> how about heat pipe?
19:46 <+Dax> no
19:46 <+Dax> cos it's physical
19:46 <@ChocoJon> ta
19:46 < aeroo> but you attach a fan to a heatpipe
19:46 < aeroo> and it becomes active
19:47 <+Dax> lo aero
19:47 < aeroo> lo
19:47 < aeroo> new pc bits :)
19:47 < aeroo> cpu[1-AMD Athlon(tm), 2428MHz @ 12x210 (6%)]
19:47 <+Dax> long time no hear
19:47 < aeroo> busy busy
19:47 < aeroo> doing cw atm
19:47 <+Dax> lol
19:47 <+Dax> git :)
19:47 < aeroo> 2.4ghz amd = r0x
19:47 < aeroo> its quiet too :P
19:47 < aeroo> think its XP3600+ rated :)
19:47 <@ChocoJon> so fan = active cooling and no fan = passive cooling (generally)?
19:48 < aeroo> yes choco
19:48 <@ChocoJon> cool
19:48 < aeroo> why ?
19:48 < aeroo> www.bath.ac.uk/~ma1sah/mobo.jpg <- active cooling on northbridge
19:48 <+Dax> XP3600+?? blow meh!
19:49 < aeroo> well the XP3200+ is 2.2ghz with 200fsb
19:49 < aeroo> so logically the xp3400 is 2.3, and xp3600 is 2.4
19:49 < aeroo> i tell you one thing
19:49 <@ChocoJon> a friend was saying that http://www.zalman.co.kr/english/product/zm80a-hp.htm (GF4 heat pipe) was active cooling...
19:49 < aeroo> this is faster than my p4 3.3ghz
19:49 < aeroo> nah thats passive
19:49 < aeroo> its quite cool tho
19:49 < aeroo> works best if you direct a case fan onto it
19:50 < aeroo> unless you have very good air flow
19:50 < aeroo> radeon 9800's out soon \o/
19:50 <+Dax> and how much did it cost?
19:50 <@ChocoJon> won't fit in my shuttle though... :-( *snigger*

23:40 <@draq> visiting an old friend from south africa
23:40 <@draq> and seeing some old friends from helsinki
23:40 <@draq> some of the pictures are up on my webpage
23:41 <@Kam> in italy
23:41 <@draq> Italy was better than I ever expected.
23:41 <@draq> great architecture and art stuff
23:41 <@Kam> so u went to italy to meet ppl from africa and helsinki
23:41 <@draq> yup
23:41 <@draq> 320 EUROs
23:42 <@draq> for the flight
23:42 <@draq> could have some more memory and a gameboy instead
23:42 <@draq> but tbh, I think it was worth it
23:42 <@draq> hadn't seen the one guy for 7 years
23:42 <@draq> and we used to be close :)
23:43 <@draq> Italian food was great too. And french(went through Paris)
23:43 <@draq> Finland sucks in comparison. no culture here

22:44 <@Xiven> i have a dead hard drive and i'd really like to recover some stuff from it
22:44 <@anyone> no i cant
22:44  * Xiven bitchslaps kam
22:45 <@Xiven> so has anyone got a copy of spinrite or similar?
22:45 <@anyone> do u have spinrite on the dead hard drive
22:45 <@Xiven> no
22:45 -!- anyone is now known as Kam
22:45 <@Xiven> that would be far too ironic
22:45 <@Xiven> and the universe would implode
22:47 <@Xiven> of the 16 other people in this channel, no-one else is actually able to speak it would seem
22:47 <@Kam> just ask chocojon directly
22:47 <@Kam> he will answer eventually
22:47 <@Xiven> i will try
22:48 <@Kam> bonne never says anything
22:48 <@Kam> draq couldnt help a fly
22:48 <@Kam> glimmerman just plays games
22:48 <@Kam> gwief is useless
22:48 <@Kam> hixie clearly wouldnt have it
22:48 <@Kam> NeilOfDoom might but its not C++ related 
22:48 <@Kam> NoVisAnima is too busy playing silly games
22:48 <@Kam> and [mat] is too busy changing his nick
22:49 <@Xiven> :)
22:49 <@Kam> god knows what evo does, and this will probably cause him to say something cos his name is in evolution and he gets annoyed when ppl say that
22:49 <@Kam> aero cant do anything other than quake 3
22:49 <@Kam> g0d is well g0d
22:49 <@Kam> so not much help there
22:49 <@Kam> kaya i have no idea
22:49 < Kaya> Kam: "MY NAME IS HIPPIE WHAT IS YOURS
22:49 < Kaya> ?" No idea about that? 
22:49 <@Xiven> kaya is a bot
22:49 < Kaya> Xiven: Not if I can help it. 
22:49 <@Kam> ok
22:50 <@Kam> ranger i dont really know
22:50 <@Kam> and same with UrBantus and _Tommy
22:51 <@Kam> u would think they would all wake up and defend themselves or something =)
22:51 <@Xiven> you would
22:51 <@Xiven> but apparently not
22:53 <@NoVisAnima> urm...yeah i just play silly games
22:54 <@NoVisAnima> i'm not going to go and deny it
22:54 <@Xiven> heh
22:55 <@NoVisAnima> if something goes wrong with my computer i just hit it... if the problem hasn't fixed itself... i worry and hope it wont be there the next time
22:55 <@Xiven> but are you a source of the mysterious hard drive recovery utilities?
22:55 <@Xiven> i'm guessing not...
22:55 <@Xiven> my quest must continue
22:55 <@NoVisAnima> i've only had a hard drive die once
22:56 <@NoVisAnima> and it was due to a faulty mobo

23:20 <@Kam> well thats the session file failing to open
23:20 <@Xiven> looks like it
23:20 <@Kam> so yes probably
23:21  * Nana` grumbles
23:21 <@Nana`> stupid people
23:21 <@Nana`> i bet they have upgraded to some knobs and whistles version of php
23:21 <@Nana`> and now all of my code will be crap
23:21 <@Nana`> and useless
23:21 <@Kam> well did they tell u they were changing something?
23:22 <@Kam> that looks like a mis configured php 
23:22 <@Nana`> it's not my hosting
23:22 <@Nana`> it's someone else's
23:22 <@Nana`> they pay, I write the crap :D
23:22 <@NoVisAnima> that 's one thing you dont have to worry about with bucs... nope they aren't going to upgrade
23:22  * Nana` concedes that her php code is, in fact, totally crap
23:23 <@Nana`> but i've changed most of the pages to be marginally less crap
23:23 <@Kam> im sure those errors arent your fault
23:23 <@Kam> u dont specify where the session data is stored
23:24 <@Kam> u can supress the warnings but if the session data isnt getting stored then your login wont work

23:25 <@Kam> hmm
23:26 <@NoVisAnima> nicely though we've just done a design change
23:26 <@Kam> i dont know if u can set where php puts its session files

23:26 <@Kam> on a per script basis
23:26 <@Kam> umm

23:27 <@Nana`> LMAO
23:27 <@Nana`> ROFFLE
23:27 <@Xiven> and learn to spell organiser :)

23:29 <@Nana`> pretty calendar
23:29  * Nana` cries with pain at having less done
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> actually all the forms are mine mwahaha
23:29  * Nana` also cries with pain at only knowing old style html and botched css
23:29  * NoVisAnima cries that he can only manipulate html and php rather than write anything of his own
23:29 <@Nana`> I don't ever want to see anyone else's software project ever again
23:30 <@Nana`> becuase every time i do, i just feel bad
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> ~:(
23:30 <@Kam> why is there a teepee on yours
23:30 <@Nana`> i was wondering that
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> because we are team p => teepee
23:31 <@NoVisAnima> it all makes sence
23:31 <@Kam> why can i log out
23:31 <@NoVisAnima> well there is no accounts or logging in yet
23:32  * Nana` could just copy and paste hers from cosplay UK...except it sucks
23:32 <@Kam> although it may look more done it really isnt after clicking on many things
23:32 <@Nana`> http://www.anime.me.uk/gallery/details.php?image_id=2160 <---i really love that pic
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> ours has forms
23:33 <@Kam> yes
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> that's it really
23:33 <@Kam> but nothing does anything yet =)
23:33 <@Nana`> mine has a notes page!
23:33 <@Nana`> HAAAAAAH
23:33 <@Nana`> (except it only displays the note titles)
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> and the address and notes ones moan if things are missing (as of this afternoon)
23:33  * Nana` can't figure out how to access previous parts of an array
23:33 <@Nana`> :(
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> all our arrays get indexed
23:34 <@Nana`> NO!
23:34 <@Nana`> we must stop talking!
23:34 <@Nana`> it's making me feel super bad
23:34 <@Nana`> that my group is doing jack shit :(
23:34 <@Nana`> GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR why
23:34 <@Kam> how to access "Previous" parts of an array?
23:34 <@Nana`> well, i have walked through the array to generate the list of titles
23:34 <@Nana`> now when you click on a title, i need to say "display this part of the array in this box"
23:35 <@Nana`> but i dont know how to use JS with PHP
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> ours doesn't touch the database yet ~:)
23:35 <@Kam> well every element in the array has a key
23:35 <@Kam> what do u want js for?
23:35 <@Nana`> but....isnt it an array of arrays
23:35 <@Nana`> so that it changes dynamically
23:35 <@Nana`> when you click on something on the side...it updates itself
23:36 <@Kam> updates itself...
23:36 <@Nana`> well, you click on the title of a note, and it comes up in the text box to the right
23:36 <@Kam> i see
23:36 <@Kam> ok
23:37 <@Nana`> :~(
23:37 <@Kam> well u want to generate some js using php
23:37 <@Kam> just like u would generate html
23:37 <@Nana`> :E
23:38 <@Kam> u could probably store the data in a js array and have each link put that data into the textbox when u click on it
23:38 <@Xiven> yep that would work
23:38 <@Nana`> but wouldnt it make the source file hueg
23:38 <@Nana`> *huge
23:38 <@Kam> well then u want to do a page load per item which wont using any js at all
23:39 <@Kam> or u could do a voidwars and use bits of both using an iframe
23:39 <@Nana`> but thats just the same as having HTML links
23:39 <@Kam> and u really dont want to do that
23:39 <@Kam> not it isnt
23:39 <@Kam> just having html links would be very time consuming
23:39 <@Kam> and wouldnt be very dynamic
23:40 <@Kam> generated html links are fine, but it would slower per click
23:40 <@Kam> where as using js would be a slower load time initially but quicker after that
23:40 <@Nana`> waiii
23:40 <@Nana`> :~(
23:40 <@Kam> u could seperate the notes into pages
23:40 <@Kam> then u have to a little of both
23:41  * Nana` is tired and totally confused
23:41 <@Nana`> I wish my bloody group would get their fingers out of their arses ;(
23:41 <@Kam> and wash their hands
23:41 <@NoVisAnima> at one point today it looked like we'd have another coder working
23:41 <@NoVisAnima> then he disappeared
23:42 <@Nana`> this SUCKS
23:42 <@Nana`> so much pressure
23:42 <@NoVisAnima> after telling me to change something
23:43 <@NoVisAnima> i have to admit i cant remember working for so long on something
23:43  * Nana` worked all day on graphics and it still isnt done
23:43 <@NoVisAnima> and that's mainly due to richard giving me only little tasks at a time
23:44 <@NoVisAnima> saying that though i do the more menial code tasks really
23:44 <@Nana`> BAH

21:22  * Yukari-sensei thwacked her head on the car today
21:23 <@NoVisAnima> O_o
21:23 <@NoVisAnima> how did you do that
21:24 < Yukari-sensei> well it was a different car cos ours broke down and we had a courtesy car
21:24 < Yukari-sensei> and i got in in a hurry because my mum was pulled up on the side of the road, and i wasnt used to it being lower than ours, and i smacked my head on the side of the roof, REALLY hard
21:24 <@NoVisAnima> aww
21:24 < Yukari-sensei> and later on, i managed to shut my gran's fingers in the door
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> urm
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> clever
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> today i ... watched 18 episodes of witch hunter robin
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> and felt crap
21:26 < Yukari-sensei> :( why
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> being at home
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> i HATE it here
21:28 <@NoVisAnima> everywhere there are things that either a) remind me of school and how crap it was and how crap i felt after each day b) my mum
21:29 < Yukari-sensei> can't run forever
21:29 <@NoVisAnima> i know i know
21:30 <@NoVisAnima> a) is annoying me far more than b)
21:30 < Yukari-sensei> so it was bad, it's not going to come back, move on. and think of happy times with your mum
21:30 <@NoVisAnima> HA
21:31 <@NoVisAnima> a) has completely shaped my uni life and is what drove me to insanity
21:33 < Yukari-sensei> but your school days arent going to come back
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> no
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> this i realise
21:34 <@NoVisAnima> but they have shaped my life and brought me to where i am now
21:34 < Yukari-sensei> so just concentrate on sticking two fingers up at the school suckers
21:35 < Yukari-sensei> it always makes me feel better when i see people i went to school with that gave me hassle, working in tescos or something
21:38 <@NoVisAnima> well to begin with it was the people from school
21:39 <@NoVisAnima> but i just got broke at school
21:39 <@NoVisAnima> it wasn't a few people hastling me 
21:39 <@NoVisAnima> it was most of a year looking down on me
21:40 < Yukari-sensei> oh, and ditto
21:40 < Yukari-sensei> but nobody looks down on you at uni
21:40 <@NoVisAnima> inferiority complex says otherwise

00:05 <@Xiven> yes
00:05 <@Kamakaze> lo
00:06 < draq> can you tell me how to get those yellow boxes around the pngs ? http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/debating/members.shtml
00:06 < draq> is it clear?
00:06 <@Kamakaze> lol
00:06 < draq> yeah i am fucking useless
00:06 < draq> i admit it
00:06 <@Kamakaze> img { border : solid yellow 1px;} ?
00:06 < draq> no
00:07 < draq> the div's yellow bg
00:07 <@Xiven> #FFFFCC
00:07 <@Kamakaze> div { background : yellow;}
00:08 <@Kamakaze> or whatever color u want
00:08 <@Kamakaze> or div {background-color : yellow;}
00:08  * Yukari-Sensei wishes she knew css
00:08 < draq> yes, but if you look at the page. the images are overlapping the div they should be contained in
00:09  * ChocoJon tries to be helpful by pointing out http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ to Yukari-Sensei
00:09 <@Yukari-Sensei> OH i cant be bothered to actually learn it!
00:09 <@Yukari-Sensei> i want to know it, matrix style
00:09 <@Kamakaze> they are probably float : right
00:10 <@Kamakaze> what exactly are u asking
00:10 < draq> Kamakaze: indeed they are
00:10 < draq> how do i make them float right
00:10  * Xiven still can't figure out what draq is actually asking
00:10 < draq> and be contained in this yellow box
00:10 <@Xiven> style="float:right"
00:10 < draq> they are floating right
00:11 <@Kamakaze> well that is a good question
00:11 < draq> oh christ
00:11 <@Kamakaze> i know how to make the next div not start b4 the image finishes
00:11 <@Kamakaze> but im not sure how to make the div be as big as the float image
00:12 <@Kamakaze> im sure xiven should know
00:12 <@Kamakaze> if not hes trying to look it up
00:12 <@Xiven> uh-huh?
00:12 <@Xiven> only way i can think of is to not use float
00:13 <@Xiven> and use positioning instead
00:13 <@Xiven> maybe something like position:absolute;top:0;right:0;
00:13 <@Xiven> hard to say without trying it out
00:13 <@Xiven> hmm

17:15 <@draq> game today?
17:16 < rainyah> is there any way of using the awesome political power of buncs to get resnet to open up some q3 ports for me? :)
17:17 <+Dax> which ports do you need?
17:17 <+Dax> you could remap them thru a proxy provided by a bb member of buncs
17:17 < rainyah> 27960, 27962 would probably be enough
17:18 <+Dax> (not sure about the latency tbh tho)
17:18 < rainyah> possibly one other to an external proxy
17:19 < rainyah> if we proxy'd, it'd have to be inside the uni network but outside resnet, cos everything going in/out of resnet is capped
17:19 <+Dax> q3's rates aren't too high tho
17:19 <+Dax> ?
17:20 < rainyah> not esp. but whatever they did to stop kazaa makes it unplayable, it 999s about once every 1-2 seconds
17:20 < rainyah> and warps like hell :/
17:20 < rainyah> ppl are still using kazaa 24/7 anyway, which sucks
17:21 < rainyah> they said on the resnet forum if ppl had a game on specific ports that was low bandwidth they would open them, I emailed but they didn't do anything or even reply
17:21 <+Dax> about 50% of ppl can't use Kazaa anymore
17:21 <+Dax> hasn't stopped me mind...
17:21 < rainyah> buncs should get a box somewhere on campus to host game servers, that way I could proxy from there :P
17:22 < rainyah> as a society its a legitimate use of a server imo :)
17:22 <+Dax> actually, that'd be a good idea
17:22 < rainyah> thing is, it's unlikely to happen this year now, which means I had a whole year of 10ms janet and couldn't use it for anything but irc... :/
17:22 <+Dax> Exeter's computing service run a huge no. of games servers
17:22 <+Dax> so why can't baths
17:23 < rainyah> bath's janet policy seems pretty tight tho
17:23 <+Dax> why is th[15:22] <Dax> actually, that'd be a good idea
17:23 <+Dax> [15:23] <rainyah> thing is
17:23 <+Dax> oops
17:23 < rainyah> :p
17:23 <+Dax> :/
17:23 <+Dax> Bath are average
17:24 <+Dax> some unis are more relaxed
17:24 <+Dax> some are more strict
17:24 <+Dax> but they def put resnet at the bottom of the list
17:24 <+Dax> which is a right shame
17:24 < rainyah> well emailing them didn't work... who could I go speak to in person about resnet?
17:25 < rainyah> I really don't need much, 1 port would be enough for me to use a proxy to every q3 server
17:25 <+Dax> did u email resnet@bath.ac.uk?
17:25 < rainyah> yeh
17:25 < rainyah> no reply :/
17:25 <+Dax> when?
17:25 < rainyah> when they first capped it and said to email them for game ports

17:25 <+Dax> cos when I email them they seem to have no life at all and generally reply within 10 mins or so
17:26 < rainyah> hmm, weird
17:26 <+Dax> have u tried again?
17:26 < rainyah> I kinda gave up, I wasn't playing in any leagues or anything at the time and was plenty busy at uni
17:26 < rainyah> and I'm at home atm, will try again when I get back to uni
17:27 <+Dax> tbh I only use my resnet conn for d/l movies, warez and series

19:05 <+Dax> lo
19:05 <+Dax> anyone here use Proxycap
19:05 <+Dax> ?
19:05 <+Dax> or have an alternative?
19:08 < aeronic> whats it do
19:09  * NoVisAnima is pretty sure that he'll get Zelda late since it's coming by post and mail sux
19:09 <@NoVisAnima> it's thankful i dont mind
19:09 <+Dax> erm..
19:10 <+Dax> remapping of ports
19:10 <+Dax> for use through proxies
19:10 <+Dax> I need it to use torrent thru Resnet
19:10 <+Dax> except it's expired and wants paying
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
19:11 <+Dax> Any ideas?
19:15 < aeronic> what are you torrenting
19:15 < aeronic> why dont you just use bt++ and set it to use certain ports
19:16 < aeronic> you can set a range
19:16 < aeronic> what sort of speeds do you get
19:16 < aeronic> for torrent through resnet
19:17 <+Dax> is there a new version of bt?
19:17 <+Dax> speed... usually around 100k/s
19:18 < aeronic> nice
19:18 < aeronic> i use the rate capping version of bt
19:18 < aeronic> bt++ is a different client
19:18 < aeronic> and although buggy
19:18 < aeronic> does let you choose port ranges
19:19 <+Dax> url?
19:19 < aeronic> its on sourceforge
19:19 < aeronic> check googe

15:21 <@Xiven> yes
15:21 <@NanakiXII> i think you can send but not receive

14:47 <+Dax> Raaaa
14:47 <+Dax> Anyone about with knowledge of gfx cards?
14:50 <@NeilOfDoom> only from a developer's PoV
14:50 <@NeilOfDoom> what do you want to know?
14:51 <@NeilOfDoom> dax
14:51 <+Dax> Are the GeForce FX 5200 any good?
14:51 <@NeilOfDoom> they're ok
14:51 <@NeilOfDoom> they have driver issues atm
14:52 <@NeilOfDoom> very slow shader execution compared to the radeon
14:52 <+Dax> ie - would I be better spending £70 on something else?
14:52 <@NeilOfDoom> nah I doubt it
14:52 <@NeilOfDoom> I mean a 9500 maybe
14:52 <+Dax> hmmm
14:52 <@NeilOfDoom> if I was in your position I'd probably save up and hold off a bit
14:53 <@NeilOfDoom> atm ATI is better, but the FX will pull away when the drivers get better
14:53 <@NeilOfDoom> of course the 9800Pro is the best card available :)
14:53 <+Dax> rofl
14:53 <+Dax> yeah if ya loaded :)
14:53 <@NeilOfDoom> mmm not cheap
14:53 <+Dax> my gf4 ti is at home... and I'm selling my gf2mx this week, so I *need* a cheap replacement

14:55 <@NeilOfDoom> ah
14:55 <@NeilOfDoom> go for the fx then
14:56 <@NeilOfDoom> or the 9500, compare benchmarks first
14:56 <@NeilOfDoom> not quite sure which is faster, but both have similar capabilities
15:11 <+Dax> the 9500 is better than the FX 5200...
15:12 <+Dax> but the FX is more priced around the 9000
15:18 <+Dax> Gainward vs Leadtek... is there much difference in quality?
15:18 <@NeilOfDoom> nah
15:18 <@NeilOfDoom> both are good
15:19 <@NeilOfDoom> 5200 vs 9000, the 5200 definitely
15:19 <+Dax> lol
15:20 <+Dax> the leadtek is 4ns DDR for £69
15:20 <+Dax> and the Gainward is £87 for 5ns
15:21 <@NeilOfDoom> there's your answer then
15:22 <@NeilOfDoom> they're all reference boards anyway, there's like sod all difference now

16:05 < aeronic> someone owes me £178
16:05 < aeronic> heh
16:05 <@draq> so 200 EUR in all for mem upgrade too. hmmm... I spend 350EUR on weekend trips, so what the hell. 
16:05 < aeronic> hmm
16:06 <@draq> I want to do some sort of mirroring between my drives. Do i need RAID enabled mb?
16:06 < aeronic> er
16:07 < aeronic> you want to mirror drives
16:07 < aeronic> you need 2 identical drives
16:07 < aeronic> and you lose half your hdd space
16:07 <@draq> bugger
16:07 <@draq> and you need RAID?
16:07 < aeronic> it *is* raid
16:07 < aeronic> thats what raid means
16:07 <@draq> oh right
16:07 <@draq> i thought you need a RAID chip on the mb or something
16:07 < aeronic> yes
16:07 <@draq> and the speed?
16:07 < aeronic> you need a raid controller
16:07 < aeronic> speed is about the same
16:08 < aeronic> if youre mirroring
16:08 < aeronic> a little faster but not much
16:08 < aeronic> gives 100% redundancy tho
16:08 < aeronic> i wouldnt recommend it
16:08 <@draq> that would be nice.
16:08 < aeronic> dax has the best raid system
16:08 < aeronic> raid5
16:08 <@draq> but probably would dir at the same time :)
16:08 < aeronic> need 4 hdds tho
16:08 <@draq> but probably would DIE at the same time :)
16:08 < aeronic> lol
16:08  * draq takes a shower
16:08 < aeronic> just use cds to backup
16:09 < aeronic> or dvd or sth
16:09 < aeronic> raid is silly tbh :)
16:10 <@draq> CDs suck. and DVDs are expensive, and probably suck more (no idea)
16:16 <@ChocoJon> Question: what PSU do people think you might need if you have 8 HD in a RAID 5 array?
16:17 <@draq> 300W
16:18 <@ChocoJon> even drawing lots of current when they all spin up?
16:19 <@draq> I think so. I mean, I think a standard PSU was just 150W a couple of years ago
16:20 <@ChocoJon> why do they sell 400 W PSUs then?
16:20 <@draq> ppl like power :)
16:22 <@ChocoJon> oh ok
16:22 <@ChocoJon> ty
16:27 < aeronic> er
16:27 < aeronic> 235W 
16:27 < aeronic> for ages
16:27 < aeronic> and if you have a p4 3ghz and r9700 or gffx its recommedned 350/400w
16:27 < aeronic> my cpu alone draws 100W
16:27 < aeronic> say 75W from gfx
16:27 < aeronic> most 300W psus couldnt cope
16:28 < aeronic> 20W per hdd isnt it
16:28 < aeronic> so 8*20 = 160
16:30 < aeronic> and a hdd takes all its power from 12v doesnt it ?
16:30 < aeronic> whereas a 300W rating is 3+5+12
16:36 <@ChocoJon> I think so
16:36 <@ChocoJon> so what rating do you suggest?
16:40 < aeronic> for what
16:41 < aeronic> 8hdds + gfx + cpu + mobo

16:42 <@ChocoJon> yup
16:46 < aeronic> prolly 450W min
16:46 < aeronic> i have a 420W with just 2 hdds, cdrw, dvd, cpu, gfx
16:59 <@ChocoJon> he he
17:00 <+Dax> that's VERY high...
17:00 <@ChocoJon> both other regular housemates (the other doesn't know about PCs much) both are adamant that 300 W will be "easily enough" (may be slightly misquoting but the sentiment is the same)
17:05 <@ChocoJon> we shall see though

17:34 < aeronic> dax, my gfx takes 70W
17:34 < aeronic> my cpu takes 170W
17:35 < aeronic> thats 240 total
17:35 < aeronic> if ihad a 300W then that only leaves 60W
17:35 < aeronic> and each usb is getting on for 5W
17:35 < aeronic> and hdd and cdrw about 15 ea

17:44 <+Dax> 170W for yoiu CPU?
17:44 <+Dax> How much power do you push into it?
17:45 < aeronic> lol 
17:45 < aeronic> i meant 100W
17:45 < aeronic> = 170w total
17:45 < aeronic> i was ahead of myself
17:45 <+Dax> lol
17:45 < aeronic> most 300W psu's cant deliver 300W tho
17:45 <+Dax> that sounds more like it
17:45 <+Dax> still 70w on the modern gfx cards is a lot
17:45 < aeronic> but each onboard thing on my mobo is 3-5W
17:46 < aeronic> usb, firewire, sound, lan, modem,  ps2, 
17:46 < aeronic> etc etc
17:46 < aeronic> onboard raid
17:46 < aeronic> all eats power
17:49 <+Dax> ah - all the new boards have loads of USB and 1394....

18:03 < aeronic> and 100W is quite conservative for my cpu
18:03 < aeronic> its 80W @ 2.17ghz with 1.65v
18:03 < aeronic> mine is 2.4ghz with 1.75v

23:37 <+Dax> nah
23:37 <+Dax> it's recent
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
23:37 <+Dax> cos I've used colour
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> i thought colours have been disabled since before you were here
23:38 <+Dax> then they were un-disabled for quite a while
23:40 <@NoVisAnima> someone saw the light then
23:40 <@Xiven> it was +C for ages
23:40 <@Xiven> someone removed all channel flags
23:40 <@Xiven> i put them back :)
23:41 <+Dax> aaah
23:41 <+Dax> shame bout +C :)
23:41 <@Xiven> no it's really not
23:41 <@NoVisAnima> i knew it was always there

16:31 <@draq> when i ran bchunk, a shitty program on it. it spat out two isos
16:31 <@aeronic> whats up with that
16:32 <@aeronic> get a better program then
16:32 <@aeronic> :)
16:32 <@draq> one iso mounts ok, other gets bad fs
16:32 <@draq> yes, but i deleted the orig. bin 1
16:32 <@Xiven> yep, use nero, oh wait sorry you can't
16:32 <@draq> yes, but i deleted the orig. bin !
16:32 <@Xiven> well
16:32 <@draq> k3b in linux does it
16:32 <@Xiven> you are a fool then
16:32 <@aeronic> you cannot create an iso from a .cue file
16:32 <@aeronic> without a binary
16:32 <@draq> i wonder if i can : cat ctp-con101.iso >> ctp-con102.iso
16:33 <@draq> aeronic: i know that (DUG)
16:33 <@draq> .iso(s) -> .cue and .bin 
16:33 <@aeronic> yup
16:33 <@draq> how ?
16:33 <@aeronic> so whats the prob
16:33 <@aeronic> er
16:33 <@aeronic> winiso
16:33 <@Xiven> the problem is
16:34 <@aeronic> or daemon tools and blindread
16:34 <@Xiven> he used a program to convert the cue/bin to iso
16:34 <@Xiven> then deleted the bin
16:34 <@aeronic> k
16:34 <@aeronic>  well convert them again
16:34 <@Xiven> then realised it had created 2 isods
16:34 <@aeronic> aah
16:34 <@Xiven> "THEN DELETED THE BIN"
16:34 <@aeronic> so whats the prob
16:34 <@Xiven> he has 2 isos
16:34 <@Xiven> he needs 1
16:34 <@aeronic> delete one that doesnt work
16:34 <@aeronic> heh
16:35 <@Xiven> it created 1 for each track
16:35 <@Kamakaze> i actually just died in wind waker so im taking a break
16:35 <@Xiven> he needs both together
16:35 <@draq> LOOK FOOLS. I EXPLAIN.
16:35 <@aeronic> k whatevr
16:35 <@Xiven> i thought i just did explain
16:35 <@draq> bchunk ctp-con1.bin ctp-con1.cue ctp-con1

16:36 <@draq> I accidently :  rm ctp-con1.bin ctp-con1.cue
16:36 <@Xiven> [14:34:26] <Xiven> then realised it had created 2 isods

14:01 <@draq> NeilOfDoom: you know C?
14:01 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah
14:01 <@NeilOfDoom> s'up?
14:02 <@draq> how do i check a array has a value?
14:02 <@draq> noob question sorry :)
14:02 <@draq> if (array[5][2]) does not seem to work
14:02 <@NeilOfDoom> sorry you've lost me
14:03 <@NeilOfDoom> you mean how do you check if an array is actually that big?
14:03 <@draq> no, to see it actually has a value at array[5][2]
14:04 <@NeilOfDoom> int myarray[5][5];
14:04 <@NeilOfDoom> int someval = myarray[2][3];
14:04 <@NeilOfDoom> that would work
14:04 <@NeilOfDoom> I don't understand what you mean by "has a value" tho
14:04 <@NeilOfDoom> do you mean "have I set that value"? or do you mean "is the array big enough that it has those indices"?
14:05 <@draq>  "have I set that value"? 
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> well the answer is, no, there's no way to test
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> basically when you create an array in C, it's just a memory allocation
14:07 <@draq> ok, i will just have to set then with zero or something
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> every space in your array WILL have a value
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> but it'll be whatever was left over in memory before
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah, set them all to 0
14:07 <@NeilOfDoom> say you do:
14:08 <@NeilOfDoom> int myarray[10][20];
14:08 <@NeilOfDoom> memset( myarray, 0, 10 * 20 * sizeof(int) );
14:08 <@draq> memset does it?
14:09 <@NeilOfDoom> memset sets an area of memory to 0
14:09 <@NeilOfDoom> so you can use it to set all values in an array to 0
14:09 <@NeilOfDoom> note it sets bytes, not array spaces so you need to multiply the area of memory by sizeof(int)
14:11 <@draq> I see. Thanks
14:13 <@NeilOfDoom> s'ok
14:13 <@NeilOfDoom> C isn't amazingly friendly ;)
14:15 <@draq> isn't that a bit dangerous just give you memory without it being cleaned up or something :)
14:15 <@NeilOfDoom> only if the programmer is an idiot ;)
14:15 <@NeilOfDoom> it's the fast method
14:16 <@NeilOfDoom> time to play Zelda :D
14:17 <@draq> can i resize arrays once I started using them=

18:49 <@NeilOfDoom> but I won't spoil it
18:49 <@NoVisAnima> i had all these dscaler snapshots
18:49 <@NoVisAnima> and then it went and crashed while i was trying to save them
18:50 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
18:50 <@NoVisAnima> i mean some of them i was taking while the sun was rising
18:50 <@NoVisAnima> and i didn't notice i was sailing right into a cyclone
18:53 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
18:53 <@NeilOfDoom> fought any sea creatures yet?

18:54 <@NeilOfDoom> 1) no matter which weapon you use, it autotargets the eyes

18:54 <@NeilOfDoom> 2) there are loads weapons you can use
18:54 <@NeilOfDoom> I think my boomerang method was a bit ineffective
18:54 <@NoVisAnima> that doesn't make it better
18:55 <@NeilOfDoom> ok sorry to take away the split second it'll take you to figure out what you're supposed to do when you come across one ;)
18:57 <@NoVisAnima> those split seconds are what makes this game

00:08 <@Shiva|Work> um...first one i went into costa coffee to get something to eat, and they were taking ages even though there wasnt anyone else in the queue
00:08 <@Shiva|Work> and they said could i take some food to this guy, so i said ok
00:08 <@Shiva|Work> so i got it and went to this completely empty room, like when you first mvoe into a new house
00:09 <@Shiva|Work> and he came towards me like he was going to attack me, and then the costa coffee man came in and saved me
00:09 <@Shiva|Work> second one...i dont remember that much of what happened except he was going to attack me again and i was helpless
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> ok they just sound plain weidr
00:12 <@NoVisAnima> i know i had some strange dream this morning but it was one of those ones that you forget the instant you open your eyes

21:19 <@NoVisAnima> i wouldn't know about that one
21:19 <@NoVisAnima> what did you think about the bit with the master sword
21:19 <@NeilOfDoom> I liked that :)
21:20 <@NoVisAnima> i thought it was one of the most beautiful things i've seen
21:20 <@NeilOfDoom> how far have you got now?
21:21 <@NoVisAnima> well i'm now supposed to go in these 2 places
21:21 <@NoVisAnima> i haven't been in either
21:22 <@NoVisAnima> and i'm having fun faffing around
21:22 <@NoVisAnima> i watched birds
21:23 <@NoVisAnima> and since i woke up i haven't played again
21:23 <@NoVisAnima> with the aim i'll get work done
21:24 <@NeilOfDoom> NoVisAnima :: same as me then
21:24 <@NeilOfDoom> to restore power to the master sword right?
21:26 <@NeilOfDoom> I've been pottering around finding miniquests and screts
21:26 <@NeilOfDoom> secrets
21:26 <@NeilOfDoom> found a bastard one which says something on the entrance about being told how to get in when you become a Nintendo member

21:42 < Kam> what has that got to do with nintendo VIP?
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> Kam :: well I wondered if the info was given to you as a nintendo website member
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> it'd be a nice way of making people register
21:43 < Kam> no
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> or maybe it's given when you complete the game
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> *shrug*
21:43 < Kam> ive been in there
21:43 < Kam> so no its not =)
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> the figurine place?
21:43 < Kam> yes
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> htf? :)
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> tried gliding to the switch, didn't work
21:43 < Kam> well if u dont know that by now
21:43 <@NeilOfDoom> can't hit it from a distance
21:44 <@NeilOfDoom> couldn't see any way to swing over there
21:44 < Kam> u will never complete it if u havent figured that out yet
21:44 <@NeilOfDoom> hmm :/
21:44 < Kam> what u need to do it is one of the first things i did in the game
21:44 <@NeilOfDoom> I'll have another hack at it later
21:44 <@NeilOfDoom> what, swing over?
21:44 < Kam> b4 i had the hook shot thing
21:45  * NeilOfDoom can't remember that far back
21:45 < Kam> well anyway
21:45 <@NeilOfDoom> I didn't spend much time there anyway
21:45 < Kam> a fish gives u a hint about that
21:45 < Kam> i dont recall where that fish is though
21:45 <@NeilOfDoom> maybe I can use tingle
21:46 <@NeilOfDoom> can't try now anyway because someone nicked the tv
21:46 < Kam> well i have no link cable
21:46 <@NeilOfDoom> have you been to tingle's island yet?

22:00 <@NoVisAnima> one fish
22:00 <@NoVisAnima> per square
22:01 <@NeilOfDoom> thank god :)
22:02 <@NeilOfDoom> saves me from some major boredom then
22:02 <@NoVisAnima> hehe
22:03 < Kam> they should make an actual zelda cartoon from this engine
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> nooo
22:03 <@NeilOfDoom> I wonder if the engine would be capable of running a zelda mmorpg :)
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> that would remove the gameplay ~:(
22:05 <@NoVisAnima> what i love about this is that you can look at things in your own way
22:05 <@NoVisAnima> something i never got while watching the movies of the game
22:05 <@NoVisAnima> it works so well because you play it
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> the camera's pissing me off
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> keeps getting into really awkward positions
22:07 <@NeilOfDoom> I spent most of my time twiddling with the thumbstick so that I'm not stuck on a bit of wall
22:08 <@NoVisAnima> i haven't had that
22:08 <@NoVisAnima> but then again i quite often am controlling the camera directly
22:08 <@NoVisAnima> i did it in mario

22:55 <@NoVisAnima> oh dear
22:55  * NeilOfDoom is very very very very very tempted to pick one up
22:55 <@NeilOfDoom> can play zelda in bed too then
22:55 <@NoVisAnima> O_o
22:55 <@NeilOfDoom> I heard a rumour you can get portable batteries for them too
22:55 <@NeilOfDoom> so you basically have a completely mobile system
22:55 <@NoVisAnima> i believe you can
22:55 <@NeilOfDoom> would be awesome
22:56 <@NoVisAnima> mmm
22:56 <@NoVisAnima> portable gaming system
22:56 <@NeilOfDoom> Using a Kung-Fu scale of coolness, gameplay visitors rate this item:    ULTIMATE
22:56 <@NeilOfDoom> BAD ASS!

22:56 <@NoVisAnima> i might miss the 5.1 sound though ~:/
22:57 <@NeilOfDoom> you have 5.1?
22:57 <@NoVisAnima> yes i do
22:57 <@NeilOfDoom> on the cube?
22:57 <@NoVisAnima> yes
22:57 <@NoVisAnima> well it's not discreet
22:57 <@NeilOfDoom> I didn't realise it could do it
22:57 <@NeilOfDoom> ah
22:57 <@NoVisAnima> but it's still very very nice
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> zelda sounds like the most beautiful thing ever through it though
22:58 <@NeilOfDoom> I have it hooked up to the 5.1 decoder but it's not really that great
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> dolby pro logic 2
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> it works v.nicely
22:58 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah pro logic 2 isn't 5.1 tho
22:58 <@NeilOfDoom> I want xbox sound on the cube
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> what i heard was as good as
22:58 <@NeilOfDoom> full 5.1 :)
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> hearing the little clicking things in the forest click around you is just magical
22:59 <@NeilOfDoom> hmmm I better tweak my sound then :)
23:00 <@NoVisAnima> i made sure all my speakers were in the right place and now... screw the neighbours i need to hear this properly
23:00 <@NeilOfDoom> http://shop.gameplay.co.uk/webstore/productpage.asp?ProductCode=GC0036

23:24 <+Dax|Up> yes
23:24 <@Kamakaze> is that all it does?
23:24 <+Dax|Up> and I thought he was joking when he said it
23:24 <@GlimmerMan> hmmm
23:25 <@NoVisAnima> damn you
23:25 <@GlimmerMan> guess they could have made it set your home page to goatse.cx b4 crashing
23:25 <@GlimmerMan> or link you to the 'you are an idiot spammy window' page
23:25 <@NoVisAnima> i was trying to click on neils link knowing what that one did and then someone talked making me click it anyawy
23:25 <@GlimmerMan> lol
23:25 <@GlimmerMan> the perils of irc

23:28 < Hixie> (a) when's the next lan
23:28 <@GlimmerMan> u r 'special'
23:29 < Hixie> (b) why do you like IE
23:29 < Hixie> have you tried mozilla?
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> yes i have
23:29 < Hixie> popup blocking makes surfing porn sites SO much easier
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> i now have phoenix for pr0n
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> and for doing the form for our diary
23:29 <@GlimmerMan> what about sites that popup windows for downloads?
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> weee look as how IE manages to lose the POST data on the first try and needs a refresh to find it
23:30 < Hixie> GlimmerMan: it's intelligent blocking, and you can always whitelist if you really want
23:30 <@GlimmerMan> i just use alt-f4
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> urm i use IE because... windows key e -> type in addy
23:30 <@GlimmerMan> the popup killer
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> that popup killer takes time
23:30 <@NoVisAnima> and some sites wont close immidiateyl
23:31 <@NoVisAnima> a) the next lan *might* be 16th -18th *if* there is a room big enough
23:31 <@GlimmerMan> if u hit f5 they try to reload and u can kill them
23:31 <@NoVisAnima> yeah but those ones that try and make you install dialers
23:31 < Hixie> NoVisAnima: use windows key + r -> type in addy
23:32 < Hixie> the r key is right next to e
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> pfft
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> yes but that's handled by my left forefinger
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> which isn't as nice
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> that and i use windows explorer

23:32 <@NoVisAnima> ooh i've rememebered *another* special thing
23:32 <@GlimmerMan> u can rebind windows shortcut keys...
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> linux as of now has still crashed for me more times than windows
23:33 < Kama> oh
23:33 < Kama> that windows key is bound {
23:33 < Kama> [
23:33 < Kama> so thats why that doesnt work
23:33 <@GlimmerMan> u just tell it that win+e = open mozilla or whatever
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> but then it wouldn't open windows explorer
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> counter productive me thinkgs
23:34 <@GlimmerMan> pff well bind f12 = open mozilla or some other key that u never gonna use in windows :)
23:35 < Kama> bind f1 to mozilla and google
23:36  * Hixie has bound ctrl-alt-b to mozilla ("Browser")

23:38 < Hixie> also, having mozilla be the default browser means when i click a uri in irc it loads mozilla
23:38 <@NoVisAnima> that must be nice
23:42 < Hixie> it is
23:42 < Hixie> it is like nirvana
23:42 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)

23:44 < Hixie> i need a lan
23:44 <@NoVisAnima> <NoVisAnima> a) the next lan *might* be 16th -18th *if* there is a room big enough
23:44 < Hixie> actually i just need an excuse to invite GwieF and Kam down to my house, but the idea is the same.
23:44 < Hixie> ooh, that's quite soon
23:45 <@GwieF> hey may 15 is my bday
23:45 <@GwieF> ooohoo :p
23:45 < Kama> yes it is indeed
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> well i cant really do it any later
23:45 <@GwieF> you can all give me hundreds of pounds worth of presents!
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> or not
23:46 <@GwieF> awww :p
23:47  * GwieF thinks the buncs funds should go towards a give gwief a 42" plasma screen :p
23:47 < Hixie> you don't want a plasma
23:47 < Hixie> plasmas have image retention issues that are excacerbated by video games' HUDs

20:32 <@draq> I am pondering wheter to upgrade.

20:40 <@draq> Kam: should I upgrade? will i notice something ?
20:40 <@draq> :)
20:40 <@Kam> upgrade everything
20:40 <@GwieF> depends what you use it for
20:41 <@Kam> i regularly use 200mb+
20:41 <@Kam> memory
20:41 <@Kam> i run games at the same time as other things though
20:41 <@GwieF> whereas I rarely use above about 160mb
20:41 <@Kam> and some particularly memory intensive programs
20:42 <@Kam> or perhaps badly written programs
20:42 <@Kam> not really sure
20:42 <@Novis|uni> maybe a mixture of the 2
20:42 <@Kam> of course if u use mozilla less than 1.3
20:42 <@Kam> and refresh a large image over and over
20:42 <@Kam> u will be using 1 gig of ram in no time
20:43 <@Kam> i am currently using 247mb ram

21:16 < Kam> if the car could turn into a plane
21:16 < Kam> or have guns pop out
21:16 < Kam> and everyone wore weird masks with super powers
21:16 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
21:17 <@NeilOfDoom> well you can do drivebys
21:17 <@NeilOfDoom> and vice city has a helicoptor and motorbikes
21:17 <@NeilOfDoom> *shrug*
21:17 <@NeilOfDoom> it's a world away from the sorts of games you usually play I guess
21:17 < Kam> yes but does the motorbike turn into a helicopter?
21:18 < Kam> i like the 80's music
21:18 <@NoVisAnima> *snigger*
21:18 < Kam> but u have to be in a car
21:18 < Kam> and controlling the person is terrible
21:18 <@NoVisAnima> you could just use the play lists from the game
21:18 < Kam> or i could just use my mp3's
21:18 <@NoVisAnima> it's not bad in the pc version
21:19 < Kam> does it also use more than 3 car models at once?
21:19 <@NeilOfDoom> [19:18] <Kam> and controlling the person is terrible <-- controls are different now
21:19 < Kam> and things dont appear in front of u if u drive too fast
21:19 <@NeilOfDoom> they've changed them for the pc version
21:19 <@NoVisAnima> Kam the PC version is good
21:19 < Kam> yes but it has the same "plot"?
21:20 <@NeilOfDoom> [19:19] <Kam> and things dont appear in front of u if u drive too fast <-- that's a graphics engine problem, again pc version doesn't have that problem
21:20 <@NeilOfDoom> http://www.gamespy.com/articles/april03/gtavcgraphics/
21:21 < Kam> does the bloke visibly run properly?
21:22 <@NoVisAnima> Kam oh ffs#
21:22 < Kam> lol
21:23 < Kam> i mean no one runs like that
21:23 < Kam> anyway
21:23 < Kam> aside from that
21:23 < Kam> i dont like games set in world wars or current times in general
21:23 <@NoVisAnima> any particular reason?
21:24 < Kam> i just find them boring
21:24 <@NoVisAnima> ok
21:24 <@NeilOfDoom> if the gameplay and the freedom is there, I love the game
21:24 <@NoVisAnima> i'd have to agree TBH
21:25 <@NoVisAnima> i personally dont care where something is set
21:25 < Kam> yes but that affects the gameplay
21:26 < Kam> its not as if i havent tried playing it
21:26 <@NoVisAnima> yeah yeah i realise
21:26 < Kam> i played mgs for about half an hour and got bored aswell
21:26 <@NoVisAnima> which mgs
21:26 < Kam> the first one
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> half an hour
21:27 <@NeilOfDoom> odd
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
21:27 <@NeilOfDoom> I like mgs a lot
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> if you said "i played mgs2 for about half an hour"
21:27 <@NeilOfDoom> mgs pc is uber :)
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> then i would ask that you remove the word "played"
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> oh yes mgs pc is great
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> not mgs2 pc
21:27 <@NoVisAnima> NeilOfDoom your computer cant run it ~:P
21:28 <@NoVisAnima> it doesn't really run on ATI only nvidia
21:28 <@NoVisAnima> it was (badly) ported from the Xbox
21:29 <@NeilOfDoom> NoVisAnima :: I haven't tried mgs2 pc
21:29 <@NeilOfDoom> but it won't matter, I have a gf3
21:29 <@NeilOfDoom> second pc
21:29 <@NoVisAnima> hehe
21:29 <@NeilOfDoom> I expect they'll patch it for ati cards
21:29 <@NoVisAnima> you also need 7Gig free
21:29 <@NoVisAnima> they have but it's apparently not that great a patch
21:30 <@NoVisAnima> i still like the game itself
21:31 <@NoVisAnima> hmm uni useless work isn't getting done
21:31 -!- NoVisAnima [NoVisAnima@pc-138-38-249-48.bath.ac.uk] has quit [Read error: EOF from client]
21:31 < Kam> anyway its just killing ppl and stealing cars gets boring very quickly to me
21:32 < Kam> especially when u sit and watch someone do it for hours aswell
21:34 <@NeilOfDoom> Kam :: well you could argue the same about zelda
21:34 <@NeilOfDoom> GTA3 has a similar amount of sidequests to find
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> in vice city, you can ignore the plot completely and buy up real estate to start your own porn empire
21:35 < Kam> exactly
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> or you can find hidden quests and stuff
21:35 < Kam> that doesnt interest me
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> sorry hidden races, etc
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> well it does me :)
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> gta3 is a masterpiece, no doubt about that
21:35 <@NeilOfDoom> I know people who hate zelda ;)
21:37 < Kam> i just dont get a feeling of getting anywhere in vice city
21:38 <@NeilOfDoom> well each to their own
21:39 <@NeilOfDoom> at least it's an opinion you can backup
21:39 <@NeilOfDoom> unlike this guy I know who tells me planetside is shit because "an fps and a mmorpg shouldn't be put together"
21:39 <@NeilOfDoom> his reasoning being that he's "played every fps ever and is an expert"
21:39 <@NeilOfDoom> note that this guy hasn't actually played planetside :)
21:40 < Kam> its like morrowind
21:40 < Kam> morrowind was crap then ok then crap
21:40 < Kam> its very open but far too open so u had no idea what to do
21:41 < Kam> and i had fun massacring towns
21:41 < Kam> and stealing their clothes
21:41 <@NeilOfDoom> ah morrowind sufferes a bit
21:41 <@NeilOfDoom> too much open space, and too many cardboard-cutout characters
21:41 <@NeilOfDoom> they all say the same thing :
21:41 <@NeilOfDoom> :/
21:42 < Kam> yes but vice city is like that with random generated characters walking around most often the same looking
21:43 < Kam> i assume the pc version will have more variety in character models aswell =)
21:46 < Kam> well anyway i expect i would get a copy of it if i had enough hard disk space which i prob wont, so I will get more important things im sure
21:47 <@NeilOfDoom> Kam :: fair play :)
21:48 <@NeilOfDoom> VC just feels a lot denser
21:48 <@NeilOfDoom> Morrowind, I can walk for miles and not see anyone
21:48 <@NeilOfDoom> but OMG the graphics1
21:48 <@NeilOfDoom> Morrowind's weather effects = uber
21:48 < Kam> well i like jump
21:49 < Kam> i use my 2 second huge jump spell to leap around
21:49 < Kam> so i dont stay long enough to see much weather
21:49 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
21:49 <@NeilOfDoom> morrowind has a few flaws too
21:49 < Kam> the problem with free reign is that they "offer" you the ability to do everything but you clearly cant, so i guess i prefer to not have those hopes
21:49 <@NeilOfDoom> your character becomes powerful too quickly
21:50 <@NeilOfDoom> and you can get too much money
21:50 <@NeilOfDoom> and there's not enough inventory space
21:50 < Kam> well u level up by standing still jumping
21:50 < Kam> i made my money by using alchemy
21:50 <@NeilOfDoom> my mansion is FULL of junk
21:50 -!- Hoogie|CS is now known as Hoogster
21:50  * Hoogster is back from |G0dz| Fluffy Sheep | www.g0dz.com (195.20.108.85:27015). Playing Time: 01:03:03.
21:50 <@NeilOfDoom> [19:50] <Kam> well u level up by standing still jumping <-- yeah ;)
21:50 < Kam> u could just buy loads of ingredients and make potions and then sell them back for more
21:50 < Kam> then i got 100 alchemy
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> I made my money by doing things like stealing people's items and gems
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> I dropped all my items and ran into a tower
21:51 < Kam> i did enjoy killing the mages guild
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> then I stole a piece of bread from it so the guard chased me
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> t
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> then I paid the fine
21:51 < Kam> with my area effect instant death spell
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> then ran back up into the tower before he got there and stole an uber sword (white sword of woe)
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> and then my ickle lvl 2 had an uber sword :/
21:51 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
21:52 < Kam> u find out who is important to the plot by doing that u know
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> I killed all the guards at that city beginning with a v
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> that's true
21:52 < Kam> kill them one at a time and see if it tells u have broken the plot
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> I walked into this city and one guard said "that is our sacred armor, you should not wear it" and attacked me
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> so I killed him
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> so his friends attacked me
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> so I killed them too
21:52 <@NeilOfDoom> then I killed everyone else in sight
21:53 < Kam> yes standing on roofs and killing things is easy
21:53 <@NeilOfDoom> morrowind mmorpg might be fun
21:53 < Kam> yes the problem with morrowind was it didnt really feel worth it carrying on
21:53 <@NeilOfDoom> have you tried any of the expansion packs?
21:53 < Kam> no
21:53 <@NeilOfDoom> ah :)
21:54 <@NeilOfDoom> I completed the main plot, and now I have the first addon pack and some minor quests to do
21:54 <@NeilOfDoom> and there's a second addon pack out now/soon
21:54 <@NeilOfDoom> brb
21:54 <@NeilOfDoom> Tribunal is the one I have
21:54 <@NeilOfDoom> Bloodmoon = next addon
21:55 <@NeilOfDoom> http://www.elderscrolls.com/index.php?url=/games/bloodmoon_overview.htm&bg=09
21:55 <@NeilOfDoom> ok now I'll brb ;)
21:56 < Kam> i need to take a photo of makar!
21:59 <@NeilOfDoom> :)
21:59 <@NeilOfDoom> did you like Deus Ex?
21:59 < Kam> well
21:59 < Kam> for a short time
21:59 < Kam> then i realised it was a load of cos wallop
21:59 < Kam> since u couldnt do what u wanted
21:59 < Kam> the ai was crap
21:59 < Kam> u got seen u just ran back off the level and come back
21:59 < Kam> etc.
22:00 <@NeilOfDoom> hehe
22:00 < Kam> again i was expecting more than it gave
22:00 < Kam> with zelda u dont expect all that
22:00 < Kam> u just expect zelda
22:00 <@NeilOfDoom> I enjoyed the gameplay a lot but it wasn't as open-ended as everyone said
22:00 <@NeilOfDoom> just very very scripted
22:00 < Kam> yes
22:00 <@NeilOfDoom> Far Cry might be quite nice
22:01 <@NeilOfDoom> very little scripting, almost everything is AI-based
22:01 < Kam> give me true open endedness then i might like it
22:01 <@NeilOfDoom> of course it might suck too
22:01 <@NeilOfDoom> I have it on good authority that Crytek is horrible
22:01 <@NeilOfDoom> and that I shouldn't give them my money
22:02 < Kam> well
22:02 < Kam> i cant think of any games that I want atm pc wise
22:02 < Kam> apart from world of warcraft 
22:02 < Kam> and starcraft 2
22:02 < Kam> but thats something else
22:03 < Kam> oh wait
22:03 < Kam> i guess i want half life 2
22:03 <@NeilOfDoom> :)
22:03 <@NeilOfDoom> doom3?
22:03 < Kam> although i will never be able to complete it without cheating
22:03 < Kam> doom3 not really
22:03 <@NeilOfDoom> sims superstar? :D
22:04 <@NeilOfDoom> I want deus ex 2, thief 3
22:04 <@NeilOfDoom> duke nukem forever for a laugh
22:04 <@NeilOfDoom> (bet it sucks)
22:04 <@NeilOfDoom> doom3 of course
22:04 < Kam> everyone is all doom 3, but i dont like the look of it at all
22:05 < Kam> i mean sure it looks graphically impressive
22:05 < Kam> and i expect i will play it for all of 5 minutes perhaps if accompanied by the entire of buncs in a well lit room
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> Kam :: it looks scary
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> that's why I want it
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> I like scary games
22:06 < Kam> i do not
22:06 <@NeilOfDoom> Clive Barker's Undying was uber :D
22:07 <@NeilOfDoom> I like Res Evil on my gc too, in the middle of the night
22:07 <@NeilOfDoom> that bit where the dogs jump through the window made me drop my pad
22:07 <@GwieF> kam did you try freelancer?
22:07 <@NeilOfDoom> ohhhhhhhhh freelancer is soooooo nice :D
22:07 < Kam> no
22:07 < Kam> i find i cant play things like that
22:07 <@GwieF> can't play tings like that???
22:08 <@GwieF> did you even try it?
22:08 < Kam> 3d space shooters?
22:08 <@NeilOfDoom> I have an urge to unpack my ff joystick and play IWar2 multiplayer again
22:08 <@GwieF> well I guess it is sort of.. but its mouse controlled
22:08 < Kam> i find spinning around lots with the other ships spinning around me shooting me while i cant shoot them
22:08 <@GwieF> use the afterburner
22:09 < Kam> sure u say that now
22:09 <@GwieF> freelancer wasn't very hard
22:09 <@GwieF> but was good fun
22:09 <@GwieF> if only it had had randomly generated items like diablo II I'd still be playing it :)

17:22 <@aeronic> yea
17:22 <@aeronic> sounds about right

17:56 < endeavour> so...
17:56 < endeavour> what do I go for?
17:56 < endeavour> the new ones and hope that it gets a data connection installed
17:56 < endeavour> or go for westwood
17:57 <+Dax> new ones
17:58 <+Dax> they should get the resnet sorted quite quick on those...
17:58 <+Dax> they did in John Wood
17:59 <+Dax> on the form do they give you a choice between 'NEW' Eastwood and 'OLD' Eastwood?
17:59 <+Dax> cos they're about as opposite in standards of living as you can get

18:17 < endeavour> is john wood newly built too then
18:17 < NanakiXII> no
18:18 <+Dax> John Wood main building is like 5 years old
18:18 < NanakiXII> http://www.mgs2online.com/gallery/viewimage.php?iid=96 <----ROFL
18:18 <+Dax> and the court (where I live) is 2-3 years
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> lo NanakiXII
18:19 < NanakiXII> hi
18:20 <@NoVisAnima> oh dear
18:20 <@NoVisAnima> just oh dear
18:22 -!- GwieF [gwief@modem-1943.gorilla.dialup.pol.co.uk] has quit [Ping timeout]
18:23 < endeavour> how are they going to upgrade rooms whilst people are in them
18:24 < endeavour> invade peoples rooms to fit network ports?
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> well they could do that
18:24 < NanakiXII> thats prolly a lie :P
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> i'd assume that new rooms have network ports
18:24 < endeavour> decisions decisions
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> they'd just have to connect all the crap underground
18:25 < endeavour> I don't mind being without a network for a month or two
18:25 < endeavour> but will they definitely fit it?
18:25 <@NoVisAnima> maybe
18:25 <@NoVisAnima> eventually
18:25 <@NoVisAnima> i dunno
18:26 <@NoVisAnima> i dont need to look into onsite acommodation any more ~
18:26 <@NoVisAnima> p
18:27 < endeavour> says
18:27 < NanakiXII> knowing them, no
18:27 < endeavour> "Malborough court and soldsbury court are due to be networked by October, but this cannot be guaranteed until the building works are completed."
18:27 < endeavour> that presumably means it can be guaranteed when they are complete
18:28 < NanakiXII> never heard of them!
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> that would probably be what they are getting at
18:28 < endeavour> mm
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> NanakiXII: i would guess those would be the new building
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> s
18:28 < endeavour> perhaps i will for the new rooms
18:28 < endeavour> go
18:28 < endeavour> other thing is
18:28 < endeavour> it says "En-suite shower" as opposed to pod
18:29 < endeavour> i presume that means seperate room with toilet etc
18:29 < endeavour> or does it literally mean just a shower
18:29 <@NoVisAnima> O_o
18:29 <@NoVisAnima> i have no idea
18:30 <@NoVisAnima> dont say they are making "nice" accomodation
18:30 < NanakiXII> i expect it means just a shower
18:30 < NanakiXII> it wont be as luxurous as all that!
18:31 < endeavour> its more money than the pods though
18:31 < endeavour> only by about £3
18:31 < endeavour> perhaps its just because its new
18:31 <@NoVisAnima> the pods were great
18:31 <@NoVisAnima> i mean they just instantly clogged up
18:32 < endeavour> hehe
18:32 <+Dax> Pods suckj
18:32 <+Dax> I'd rather share a bathroom than have a pod
18:33 <@NoVisAnima> *nod*
18:33 < NanakiXII> Ha ha
18:33  * NanakiXII shared a bathroom and toilet
18:33 <@NoVisAnima> but since i was on campus it was pod ... or internet
18:33 < NanakiXII> it was right opposite my room
18:33 <+Dax> I have 2 loos next to my room :)
18:34 <@NoVisAnima> *nod*
18:34 <+Dax> but pods are noisy smelly yucky
18:34 <+Dax> and take up valuable room space
18:35 <@NoVisAnima> yes i would agree to all the above

18:35 < endeavour> ok
18:35 < endeavour> shall I go for the new one then and pray the fit a data connection
18:35 < endeavour> or make friends with someone in another block who feels like putting a wireless access point in their room
18:35 < endeavour> lol
18:36 <@NoVisAnima> the only good / funny thing about the pod was having the door shake violiently during this really bassy bit
18:36 <@NoVisAnima> *snigger*
18:36 <+Dax> wireless access point -- rofl
18:37 <@NoVisAnima> you mean like in the plug
18:37 < endeavour> :P
18:39 <+Dax> aaah the new Eastwood is called Solsbury and Marlborough court...
18:40 <+Dax> "scheduled for completion by September 2003".... like they'll manage that!
18:40 < endeavour> ??
18:40 < endeavour> why do you say that
18:40 <@NoVisAnima> because they aren't finished
18:40 <@NoVisAnima> it's a standard thing with buildings 
18:41 <@NoVisAnima> they dont get finished on time
18:41 < endeavour> well presumably they will be
18:41 < NanakiXII> nope
18:41 < endeavour> becuase they are on the accommodation form
18:41 <+Dax> if you saw them now.. they're shells of buildings
18:41 <@NoVisAnima> IIRC our house when we moved in was about 1 week before completion
18:41 < NanakiXII> last year there were huge probs because buildings werent finished
18:41 <@NoVisAnima> yup
18:41 < NanakiXII> room sharing *cough*
18:41 <@NoVisAnima> *snigger*
18:41 <+Dax> Carpenter house wasn't finished this year
18:42 <+Dax> £71/week for the new place!!!
18:42 <@NoVisAnima> hey it might be nice
18:42 <@NoVisAnima> lo
18:42 <@NoVisAnima> l
18:42 <+Dax> it'd better be for that money!
18:43 <@NoVisAnima> aaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhh
18:43 <@NoVisAnima> cant flo head the fucking washing machine
18:43 <@NoVisAnima> it just wont stop
18:43 <+Dax> and they *still* haven't got rid of Wessex + Norwood Houses
18:44 < endeavour> mm
18:44 <@NoVisAnima> got rid of?
18:44 < endeavour> i'm in a dilemma now
18:44 < endeavour> what do I put down on this form
18:44 < NanakiXII> eastwood!!!
18:44 < endeavour> Do you seriously not think the new buildings will be finished?
18:44 < NanakiXII> Seriously, i don't think they will
18:44 < NanakiXII> considering what the look like now, and last years incompetence, no
18:44 <@NoVisAnima> you put on the form "dont put me in a place which is dangerous"
18:45 < NanakiXII> Hm
18:45 <@NoVisAnima> then you'll get to sleep in the library
18:45 < NanakiXII> the best choice would be brendon court, if it didnt have the scabby choices meal plan

18:45 <@NoVisAnima> ugh for choises
18:45 <+Dax> <@NoVisAnima> got rid of? --> they were suppose to stop using them this year, not the year after next
18:45 <@NoVisAnima> i ended up back in tehre recently
18:45 <@NoVisAnima> aah i c
18:45 <@NoVisAnima> what would they be used for instead?
18:46 <+Dax> offices
18:46 <+Dax> like most of wessex house is now
18:46 <+Dax> I like the way the photos inside Westwood are specially taken to make it look vaguely spacious
18:46 <@NoVisAnima> oh right
18:47 <@NoVisAnima> >_< the westwood bedrooms are bigger than my bed room here
18:48 <+Dax> ouch
18:48 <+Dax> They even make choices look fancy
18:48 <@NoVisAnima> look fancy
18:48 <@NoVisAnima> i dont think that's actually too hard
18:48 <@NoVisAnima> i think i remember there is one angle you can take that so long as it's clean it looks .... normal
18:49 <@NoVisAnima> but photos just dont show you the food
18:50 <+Dax> aaah
18:50 <+Dax> thats it
18:50 <+Dax> no food on display
18:51 <@NoVisAnima> *food*
18:52 <@NoVisAnima> what was quite amusing was listening to the people advertising the changes being made to the melting pot... and saying that there would be a coffee bar place in fresh
18:52 <@NoVisAnima> obviously we mentioned that it wasn't the nicest place to be in choices
18:52 <+Dax> coffee bar place in fresh - eh?
18:52 <@NoVisAnima> oops 
18:52 <@NoVisAnima> i mean choices
18:52 <+Dax> oh, choices
18:52 <@NoVisAnima> soz
18:53 < NanakiXII> my mouse is realy annoying
18:53 <+Dax> what were these changes to Melting Pot anyway?
18:53 <@NoVisAnima> complete redesign
18:53 <+Dax> NanakiXII slap it
18:53 < NanakiXII> i did
18:53 <@NoVisAnima> scare it with the cat
18:53 < NanakiXII> i frequently shake it
18:53 < NanakiXII> it was crap when i got it
18:53 <+Dax> NoVisAnima, was that earlier this year?
18:53 <@NoVisAnima> mine ruled when i got it and it still rules
18:53 <@NoVisAnima> no that was about a few weeks ago
18:54 <@NoVisAnima> they'll be doing over the summer]
18:54 <+Dax> aaah

18:54 <@NoVisAnima> \o/
18:54 <+Dax> well... I'm looking forward to 2004

22:21 -!- mode/#buncs [+o draq] by Q
22:21 <@Kam> lo draq
22:22 <@Kam> it is because
22:22 <@Kam> of your code smaples
22:22 <@Kam> they have loads of white space
22:22 <@Kam> which makes it wide
22:23 <@Kam> well
22:23 <@Kam> that page
22:23 <@Kam> has a huge form
22:23 <@Kam> http://kiv.ath.cx/~hendry/log/pyblosxom.cgi/hoasnet/update.html
22:23 <@Kam> select the code sample of that entry
22:23 <@Kam> u will see the extra space to the right
22:25 <@draq> Yes I guess you are right
22:26 <@draq> Also I noticed a width problem with the comments form
22:26 <@draq> anyway, any comments about me style sheet?
22:27 -!- Netsplit over, joins: @Novis|out, @Hixie
22:28 <@draq> Notice how it actually comforms to XHTML1.1

23:29 <@NeilOfDoom> how do you form a user-agent string for the http protocol?
23:30 <@Xiven> send a header of "User-Agent: My User agent"
23:31 <@Xiven> where's the bit that's stumping you?
23:36 <@NeilOfDoom> Xiven :: the format
23:36 <@NeilOfDoom> didn't realise I needed a :

23:59 <@draq> why is my formatter doing that all of a sudden
--- Day changed Tue May 27 2003
00:00 <@Xiven> no idea
00:00 <@Xiven> perhaps it's seeing that you're outputting XML, thinking you're doing RSS and escaping everything for you
00:00 <@Xiven> I really don't know
00:01 <@draq> shaft
00:01 <@draq> text/html works. 
00:01 <@draq> ok, i will figure it out
00:01 <@Xiven> mkay
00:02 <@draq> Xiven: I do not know about this xmlrpc stuff
00:02 <@draq> How do I know if mine works?
00:02 <@draq> I now have a pingback link in my head...
00:02 <@Xiven> you test it
00:02 <@Xiven> ok hold on
00:04 <@Xiven> well i just attempted a pingback from dummy-blog.org
00:04 <@Xiven> doesn't seem to have worked..?
00:04 <@Xiven> i shall use my infinitely superior testing system
00:05  * draq doesn't know wtf is going on
00:06 <@Xiven> [string] => produce xmlrpc fault here

13:13 <@draq> I know I set width accidently on my input to 800%

13:13 <@draq> but that does not explain some extra width
13:13 <@draq> on the pre
13:13 <@draq> but I guess it is blank space
13:14 <@Xiven> could be
13:14 <@draq> so it is not a problem
13:14 <@draq> pingback... that is a problem
13:14 <@draq> Is my XMLRPC server not working?

22:56 <@Xiven> hello
22:58 <@Xiven> you see for all I know, you could have been saying "Me", and I would have thought "eh?".  By using English in an English speaking channel, you eliminate that particular source of confusion
23:01 <+Dax> moi is french for me
23:01 <+Dax> everyone knows that!
23:01 <@Xiven> yes
23:01 <@Xiven> but that's not what he meant

23:01 <@Xiven> you are proving my point

20:55 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah for about 2mins
20:55 <@NeilOfDoom> aeronic :: I was speccing a computer (although it's a bit too expensive)
20:55 <@aeronic> ah
20:55 <@aeronic> p4 2.8c is my choice
20:55 <@aeronic> but pricfey
20:55 <@aeronic> -f
20:55 <@NeilOfDoom> too much
20:56 <@aeronic> how much can you spend on subsystem
20:56 <@aeronic> cpu mobo memory
20:56 <@NeilOfDoom> well little as possible, but there's no point in not doing it properly
20:56 <@aeronic> well an xp2600 is cheap
20:56 <@aeronic> dont you have something comparable currently tho
20:56 <@NeilOfDoom> I was thinking, barton 2800, epok nforce2 mobo (the ultra400 one)
20:56 <@NeilOfDoom> I have an xp1800
20:56 <@NeilOfDoom> but it's chugging a bit in cpu performance
20:57 <@aeronic> i dont really like the epox nf2
20:57 <@aeronic> prefer the abit
20:57 <@NeilOfDoom> ram could be better
20:57 <@aeronic> but its fine
20:57 <@NeilOfDoom> wondering about ram
20:57 <@aeronic> no choice to be made
20:57 <@NeilOfDoom> ocz dual channel stuff seems the best bet
20:57 <@aeronic> twinmos pc3200 winbond CH5
20:57 <@aeronic> is faster and cheaper than ocaz
20:57 <@aeronic> ocz
20:57 <@NeilOfDoom> why not pc3500?
20:57 <@aeronic> cos this stuff does pc4000 speeds
20:58 <@aeronic> its the same modules that corsair xms3500 uses
20:58 <@aeronic> but at a cheaper price
20:58  * NeilOfDoom prices it
20:58 <@aeronic> £60 per 512
20:58 <@aeronic> last time i looked
20:58 <@aeronic> komplett.co.uk
20:58 <@NeilOfDoom> what about the dual channel though?
20:58 <@aeronic> it runs dual channel cas2522
20:58 <@aeronic> no problems
20:58 <@aeronic> at over 200mhz
20:58 <@aeronic> i think 255 is the record
20:58 <@aeronic> for dual channel
20:58 <@aeronic> and 265
20:58 <@aeronic> for singel
20:58 <@NeilOfDoom> sec looking
20:58 <@aeronic> if youre doing graphics stuff, wouldnt a springdale and a 2.4c
20:59 <@aeronic> be better performing
20:59 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah but it's a huge price hike
20:59 <@aeronic> not really
20:59 <@aeronic> springdale mobo = £100
20:59 <@aeronic> 2.4c = £135
20:59 <@NeilOfDoom> is a 2.4 going to outperform a 2800?
20:59 <@aeronic> yeah for graphics
20:59 <@aeronic> or media/divx/blah
20:59 <@aeronic> depends what you do
20:59 <@NeilOfDoom> where does the 2800 win then?
20:59 <@aeronic> and the particular application
20:59 <@aeronic> 2800 wins for games
20:59 <@NeilOfDoom> well that's really the sort of graphics I do
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> it's all down to the fpu performance
21:00 <@aeronic> ok
21:00 <@aeronic> i thought it was graphics rendering
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> 2.8c looks nice but £250
21:00 <@aeronic> pixar stylee
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> no I don't do much of that on this pc
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> I farm it off to my linux machines
21:00 <@aeronic> a 2.4c overclocks to around 3.4 if that interests you
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> I don't oc
21:00 <@NeilOfDoom> :)
21:00 <@aeronic> fairymuff
21:01 <@aeronic> whats the price like on an xp2700
21:01 <@NeilOfDoom> TwinMOS 512MB DDR PC3700 CAS2.5 (MY-005-TM)
21:01 <@aeronic> you may find it cheaper in some case
21:01 <@aeronic> oh god NO
21:01 <@aeronic> the pc3700 sucsk
21:01 <@NeilOfDoom> ah
21:01 <@aeronic> it does 233mhz but awful timings
21:01 <@aeronic> cas2.5-7-22
21:01 <@aeronic> 33
21:01 <@NeilOfDoom> TwinMOS 512MB DDR PC3200 CAS2.5 (MY-001-TM)
21:01 <@aeronic> the pc3200 winbond will do 233 cas2622
21:01 <@NeilOfDoom> Price:  £69.00   (£81.08 Including VAT at 17.5%)
21:01 <@aeronic> er
21:01 <@aeronic> is that ch5
21:01 <@aeronic> winbond
21:01 <@aeronic> it says in description
21:01 <@NeilOfDoom> TwinMOS PC3200 (DDR400) offers high performance and stability at an amazingly low price. This memory is in double-sided 32Mx8 (x16) configuration.
21:01 <@aeronic> what shop
21:02 <@NeilOfDoom> ocuk
21:02 <@aeronic> ah
21:02 <@aeronic> they only sell twinmos branded
21:02 <@aeronic> its poor
21:02 <@NeilOfDoom> ok that's why I didn't look at it
21:02 <@aeronic> one sec
21:02 <@NeilOfDoom> ta
21:02 <@aeronic> http://www.komplett.co.uk/k/ki.asp?action=info&p=30894&t=1014&l=2&AvdID=1&CatID=17&GrpID=9&s=pl
21:02 <@aeronic> thats the best memory money can buy
21:02 <@aeronic> i got mine for £63
21:02 <@aeronic> but its gone up in price
21:02 <@NeilOfDoom> I'll price this system up from komplett too then
21:03 <@aeronic>  TwinMOS DDR-DIMM with Winbond CH-5 Chip
21:03 <@aeronic>  
21:03 <@aeronic>  
21:03 <@aeronic> ch5 is important
21:03 <@aeronic> mine is bh5
21:03 <@aeronic> which isnt as good
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> I need a new case/psu too
21:03 <@aeronic> what sort
21:03 <@aeronic> steel ?
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> I want the thermaltake 2000 :)
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> don't know
21:03 <@aeronic> xaser
21:03 <@aeronic> ew :)
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> xaser looks nice
21:03 <@aeronic> im a stickler 
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> the aluminium one does anyway
21:03 <@aeronic> i like cheiftec steel ones
21:03 <@aeronic> :)
21:03 <@NeilOfDoom> the other two look tacky

21:03 <@aeronic> lianli 
21:03 <@aeronic> currently
21:03 <@aeronic> komplett are good for cpu and mobo prices

22:20 < NanakiXII> if you forget to turn up to that youre not gonig to get another chance
22:20 < NanakiXII> Bastard.
22:20 <@NoVisAnima> hehe

23:08 <@NoVisAnima> lol
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> you can spend *more* money if you get a used copy
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> does it become more valuble the more the pages are thumbed
23:10 < Nana|Grump> is windows xp going down in price any time soon?
23:11 <@NoVisAnima> i really doubt it TBH
23:11 < Nana|Grump> cos i am about to buy it if its not

23:14 < Nana|Grump> do you install it over the top of 98?
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> i would suggest doing a fresh install
23:14 < Nana|Grump> O_O and lose all me stuff!
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> you *can* install it over the top
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> i mean i did
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> but it probably wasn't the best thing...
23:15 < Nana|Grump> wh
23:15 < Nana|Grump> yt
23:15 <@NoVisAnima> well it wasn't initially pleased with being installed like that
23:15 <@NoVisAnima> it's calmed down now
23:15 < Nana|Grump> o.o
23:16 <@NoVisAnima> it'll probably be ok
23:16 <@NoVisAnima> it was really only the speed of my games that got affected
23:18 < Nana|Grump> but surely if youve only got the upgrade version...you cant do a fresh install
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> you can
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> the upgrade version means that you have to prove you had an original copy
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> that's all
23:19 < Nana|Grump> ohhh

21:22 < |Berty|> ere
21:22 < |Berty|> does anyone have active perl here?
21:25 <@Kamakaze> i probably have it installed somewhere
21:27 < |Berty|> do you have a non-demo copy?
21:27 < |Berty|> or a key or crack or something pls?
21:28 <@aeronic> astalavista.box.sk
21:28 <@aeronic> tbh
21:28 <@aeronic> or cracks.am
21:28 <@aeronic> dont mind the porn popups
21:28 <@Kamakaze> isnt it free?
21:28 < |Berty|> yeah, but for active perl?
21:28 <@aeronic> dax - for anything
21:28 <@aeronic> :)
21:30 < |Berty|> k
21:30 < |Berty|> ta
21:30 < |Berty|> darn a miss BB
21:31 <@Kamakaze> are you sure you mean active perl
21:32 < |Berty|> ASPN Perl Dev Kit 5.1 ??
21:32 < |Berty|> aka Active Perl
21:32 <@Hixie> active perl is free, last i checked
21:32 <@Hixie> it has to be.
21:33 < |Berty|> erm
21:33 <@Kamakaze> http://www.activeperl.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl
21:33 <@Kamakaze> that is active perl
21:33 < |Berty|> maybe I've got a corp version then
21:33 <@Hixie> the core perl interpreter is free.
21:33 <@Hixie> as in, free software, as in gpl.
21:34 <@Hixie> so i don't see why any version would require a code or something.
21:34 < |Berty|> oh well silly me
21:34 <@Hixie> anyway. if you are having trouble with active perl, use cygwin.
21:34 <@aeronic> i think you need to register with an email addy
21:34 < |Berty|> mine ran out a few days ago
21:34 < |Berty|> doh!
21:34 <@aeronic> or something
21:34 <@Hixie> or, get a decent OS and it'll be preinstalled :-)
21:34 <@Hixie> |Berty|: just install cygwin instead, that has a perl in it
21:35 <@Kamakaze> u dont need a liscence
21:35 <@Kamakaze> not for just perl
21:35 <@Kamakaze> i dont know about there documentation and such
21:36 < |Berty|> stupid thing is 11mb!
21:36 <@Xiven> omg huge
21:36 <@draq> Use python :)

23:02 <@NoVisAnima> my worst one IIRC was last year in westwood
23:03 <@NoVisAnima> i had just woken up and was rather tired
23:03 <@NoVisAnima> i sit down on the loo in me pod and look at my arm
23:03 <@NoVisAnima> these blobs appear... so i turn the light on and find it is deep red blood

23:34 <@NoVisAnima> for me that is ~:P
23:34 <@aeronic> really ?
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> no
23:34 <@aeronic> hehe
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> i dont need something like that
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> what would i do with it
23:34 <@aeronic> burn entire series of 24
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> i dont burn stuff as much as other people
23:35 <@aeronic> i burn prolly 50 cds a month
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> i just use it as a means for moving large files around
23:35 <+Evo> dvd discs are too expensive
23:35 <@aeronic> thats only about 7 dvds
23:35 <@aeronic> evo
23:35 <@aeronic> theyre 75p each
23:35 <@aeronic> and hold 6 times as much as a cd
23:35 <@aeronic> 75/6 = 15p
23:35 <@aeronic> how is that expensive
23:35 <+Evo> I get cds for that
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> £ per £ the same
23:35 <@aeronic> YES YOU GET CDS FOR THAT
23:35 <+Evo> yes
23:35 <@aeronic> so its the same
23:36 <@aeronic> its not 'expensive'
23:36 <+Evo> but this involves another outlay of £100+
23:36 <@aeronic> i paid £117 for my 8x cdrw
23:36 <@aeronic> and i just got £49 from ebuyer
23:36 <@aeronic> for my faulty cdrw
23:36 <@aeronic> that i sent back
23:36 <@aeronic> which was a 40x

22:15 <@draq> Kam: hear that?
22:16 <@Xiven> :)
22:16 < Kam> good then its working
22:16 <@draq> I am just setting my clock to wake me up tonight
22:16 <@draq> That is INSANE
22:16 <@draq> Can I get the Empire Report as an RSS feed?
22:17 <@Xiven> no
22:17 < Kam> what you should do is set voidwars up to fit your life not set your life up to fit voidwars
22:17 <@Xiven> the reason being
22:17 <@Xiven> the login security would not work
22:17 <@draq> Ok. 
22:18 <@Xiven> so anyone could view anyone's feed
22:18 <@draq> Btw, do you guys talk about the tech used in making Voidwars?
22:18 <@draq> Like mention how Linux is great and stuff
22:18 <@draq> It is running on linux platform right?
22:18 <@Xiven> we develop on windows
22:18 < Kam> well voidwars has nothing to with linux
22:18 <@Xiven> but yes, it's running on a linux box
22:18 < Kam> it just happens to be running on linux
22:18 <@Xiven> since that is what dreamhost use
22:18 < Kam> php, mysql and apache all run on windows
22:18 <@draq> well. PHP is opensource no?
22:19 < Kam> it is
22:19 <@draq> Well, "LAMP" could be credited
22:19 <@draq> advocacy :)
22:20 < Kam> well its an example of how u can make stuff for LAMP but use WAMP
22:20 <@draq> I wonder what the source looks like behind voidwars
22:20 <@draq> I guess just lots of php files
22:20 <@draq> and mysql
22:20 <@Xiven> indeed, it is lots of php files
22:20 < Kam> a few js files
22:21 <@draq> js is javascript?
22:21 <@Xiven> yes
22:21 <@draq> is that a "standard"?
22:21 <@draq> btw, did any of you bother to read my standards essay?
22:21 <@Xiven> not according to w3c no
22:21 <@draq> I have had no comments. I want to know if it BS.
22:22 <@Xiven> i've read it, it makes sense
22:22 <@draq> Xiven: thanks =)
22:22 < Kam> what standards essay?
22:22 <@draq> Kam: http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~hendry/log/pyblosxom.cgi/industry/standards.html
22:23 <@draq> Kam: it is rendered funny. I should fix it.
22:23 <@draq> it has...
22:24 < Kam> well i dont like that table
22:25 < Kam> its one of those ponsy hci tables where you right the opposite of one thing in the other column
22:26 <@Xiven> write
22:26 < Kam> heg
22:26 < Kam> heh
22:26 < Kam> well
22:26 <@draq> Kam: what do you prefer? a bulleted list ? :)
22:27 < Kam> when i was talking about Y class planets i almost typed "why" class planets earlier
22:27 <@draq> Kam: I have done that myself. On something else. dejavu
22:27 < Kam> well
22:27 < Kam> saying that one is very unstable and one is stable
22:28 < Kam> you want to put a header of stability
22:28 < Kam> and say why one is and one isnt
22:28 < Kam> a summary of why one is and why one isnt
22:29 < Kam> rather than just saying stability: implementations are very unstable, and standards are stable
22:29 < Kam> somethingability: implementations are very unsomethingable, and standards are somethingable
22:30 <@draq> I am using this program to crypt to lightly encrypt a file of passwds. I assumed it would be fairly safe. Until I looked at the actual binary.
22:30 <@draq> It tells how it was encrypted. I guess only logical. But once the user knows how, it is easy to attack it. Ho hum
22:32 <@draq> Kam: good point. The essay was written quickly. I could explain some things a much better.
22:32 <@draq> Kam: but then I would have define what I meant by stability. Because I had a different notion of it while writing it. Understand?
22:34 < Kam> so your notion of stability isnt very stable
22:35 <@draq> Kam: that's true. Standards do get updated...
22:36 < Kam> that was meant to be funny

23:10 < NanakiXII> (i'm on normal mode not easy)
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> well getting on its back is the key
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> do you check the menu screens because in there it does give clues about all teh enemies and bosses
23:11 <@NoVisAnima> dan was getting rather stuck before i decided to read the manual and spotted that little numebr
23:11 < NanakiXII> yeah i looked at that and tried to go on its back and it just hurt me even more than when it didn't

22:45 < nanakiXII> its called going home syndrome
22:45 < nanakiXII> my computer always breaks when it goes home and as soon as its back in bath it works fine#
22:46 <@NoVisAnima> heh maybe it got the same thing i got as soon as *i* got home
22:46 <@NoVisAnima> ... a clogged up throat and difficulty breathing
22:46 <@NoVisAnima> which just vanished
22:47  * NoVisAnima hopes for the whole summer
22:48 <@NoVisAnima> i *was* going to say earlier "i had a worse problem with a boss of one game. I'd *always* die just as he had 1 pixel of health left"
22:49 <@NoVisAnima> today i *just* killed the bugger
22:49 <@NoVisAnima> \o/

23:00 <@NoVisAnima> ~:/
23:05 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
23:06 <@NoVisAnima> that advice i gave yesterday about stopping 'messenger' ... it's slightly incorrect... you have to right click on the service, choose properties... then set the start up to disabled
23:07 <@NoVisAnima> and
23:07 <@Xiven> http://www.xiven.com/blog.php?start=11&count=1
23:07  * NoVisAnima gives nanakiXII huggles to help cheer her up
23:07 <@NoVisAnima> Xiven: yeah that's the one
23:08 < nanakiXII> will that work for all suers?
23:08 <@Xiven> in theory
23:08 <@Xiven> provided they can find My Computer in order to right-click on it
23:09 < nanakiXII> errrrrr
23:09 < nanakiXII> i just disabled it and it did it!
23:09 <@Xiven> did you stop it as well?
23:09 < nanakiXII> hmmm
23:09 < nanakiXII> lol
23:09 <@Xiven> if you didn't it won't take effect until you reboot
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> you can just stop the service instantly
23:10 <@Xiven> yep
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> heh, there's me who hadn't bothered to turn that off before
23:10 < nanakiXII> k done it
23:11 <@NoVisAnima> and still doesn't block the msn messanger spams
23:13 <@NoVisAnima> i've even started reading the spam that goes into my inbox >_<
23:22  * NoVisAnima reads emails...
23:22 <@NoVisAnima> nanakiXII: O_o you've been stealing society money
23:22 < nanakiXII> yeah!
23:22 <@NoVisAnima> oh dear
23:22 < nanakiXII> i bet richard uses that in his manifesto to oust my geniousness from the likes of chairmanship
23:23 < nanakiXII> GENIOUS!
23:23 <@NoVisAnima> yeah if it was spelt like that...
23:23 <@NoVisAnima> ~:P
23:23 < nanakiXII> it is
23:23 <@NoVisAnima> genius
23:23 < nanakiXII> oh, opz
23:23  * nanakiXII stupid
23:23 < nanakiXII> good job that wasn't on my spelling test
23:24 <@NoVisAnima> heh
23:24 < nanakiXII> (we had a test in year 7 and i got 99 out of 100)
23:24 < nanakiXII> i got cemetery wrong
23:24 <@NoVisAnima> the only reason i remembered how to spell that because i'd been spelling it incorrectly for years
23:24 <@NoVisAnima> ooh
23:24 <@NoVisAnima> my spelling used to be rather good... then came the internet and bad spelling
23:24 <@NoVisAnima> it all went down hill from there
23:25 <@NoVisAnima> i had a friend though who got 100% in one spelling test... except he managed to spell his name wrong Freeman -> freman
23:25 < nanakiXII> LOL
23:25 < nanakiXII> dur
23:25 <@NoVisAnima> that takes a special type of person
23:25 <@NoVisAnima> tom was 'special'
23:28 <@NoVisAnima> damn, i'd actually would have like to have met him after school
23:35 < nanakiXII> hurrah
23:35 < nanakiXII> i must have some kind of astrological clock
23:36 < nanakiXII> I've been dumped twice on the same day of the year
23:36 < nanakiXII> and i've dumped people twice in round about the same period

18:44 <@Xiven> well, planetary plasma cannons and shields might be a plan
18:45 <@draq> do they need to be on some sort of defence platform ?
18:45 <@Xiven> no
18:45 <@draq> What about an all round fighter ship I can utilize? 
18:45 <@Xiven> all ships have their weaknesses and strengths
18:46 <@Xiven> fighters: good against corvettes and fighters, weak to missile frigates
18:46 <@Xiven> corvettes: weak to fighters, good against frigates
18:46 <@Xiven> etc etc
18:47 <@draq> Do I need lots of them? I do not have any. I have no idea if I should build them all the time. Or just build them when I need to
18:47 <@Xiven> well, if in doubt take a look at your neighbours' fleets
18:47 <@draq> Xiven: espionage?
18:48 <@Xiven> possibly
18:48 <@Xiven> or just send probes to look at their fleets
18:48 <@draq> My stupid probes don't tell me much. 'Unknown'
18:48 <@draq> Or do I need a better probe?
18:48 <@Xiven> get probe mk II then
18:48 <@draq> mmmkay

22:12  * NeilOfDoom wonders if aeronic is still alive
22:12 <@NeilOfDoom> he must have got his degree results by now
22:13 < NanakiXII> Weee
22:13 < NanakiXII> when do 2nd year results come out then
22:13 <@NeilOfDoom> end of July
22:13 < NanakiXII> what did you get?
22:14 <@NeilOfDoom> not telling :)
22:14 < NanakiXII> tell
22:14 < NanakiXII> or i will hurt you with nested tables
22:14 <@NeilOfDoom> didn't get a 3rd at least ;)
22:14 <@NeilOfDoom> 2nd and I got my Hons
22:14 <@NeilOfDoom> so \o/ all round really
22:14 < NanakiXII> ?
22:14 <@NeilOfDoom> honours
22:14  * NanakiXII doesnt get it
22:14 < NanakiXII> i thoguht you get honours anyway
22:15 <@NeilOfDoom> nah it's possible to lose them
22:15 < NanakiXII> isnt that only if you go onto an ordinary in computing
22:15 <@NeilOfDoom> they can be taken away based on first/second year exam performance
22:15 <@NeilOfDoom> or you can fail your dissertation
22:15 <@NeilOfDoom> if you don't pass your dissertation on your first attempt, you don't get hons
22:15 < NanakiXII> ahhh
22:15 < NanakiXII> so a 2:1 then
22:15 <@NeilOfDoom> sorta
22:15 < NanakiXII> ?
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> bit lower :)
22:16 < NanakiXII> 2:2?
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> mmm
22:16 < NanakiXII> O_O you got a 2:2?!
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> I stopped working
22:16  * NanakiXII leaves university now
22:16 < NanakiXII> youre lying
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> I basically didn't put any effort into the final year
22:16 < NanakiXII> O_O
22:16 <@NeilOfDoom> I don't need the degree for jobhunting, just to emigrate
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> so I did enough to pass and put a lot of effort into some outside projects
22:17 < NanakiXII> O_O
22:17  * NanakiXII is scared now
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> which I believe was the right thing to do as I know a lot of people who are unemployed with good degrees
22:17 < NanakiXII> there's no hope!
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> nah you'll do fine
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> six 1sts on our course
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> a few failures
22:17 < NanakiXII> :/ that must be a bit crushing
22:17 <@NeilOfDoom> one "unclassified" but dunno what that is
22:18 < NanakiXII> were the ppl that got 1sts really outstanding?
22:18 < NanakiXII> maybe they didnt turn up
22:18 <@NeilOfDoom> nah apparently unclassified can mean they have outstanding debts
22:18 <@NeilOfDoom> and no, the 1sts weren't especially outstanding
22:19  * NanakiXII is well confused now
22:19 < NanakiXII> now i have no idea what i might get
22:20 <@NeilOfDoom> don't take my grade to heart, like I said, I didn't work for it
22:21 < NanakiXII> yeah but your version of not working is probably my version of flat out
22:22 <@NeilOfDoom> I doubt it
22:22 <@NeilOfDoom> the problem is, degrees aren't really geared towards people like me
22:22 <@NeilOfDoom> they're more for people who like writing essays
22:22 <@NeilOfDoom> I can't stand writing, I'd rather just program
22:23 < NanakiXII> heh...i thought i liked writing until i did english a level
22:23 <@NeilOfDoom> lol
22:23 < NanakiXII> and buggered up
22:24 <@NeilOfDoom> everyone buggers up
22:24 <@NeilOfDoom> English is a crap subject
22:24 < NanakiXII> this was a big bugger up
22:24 <@NeilOfDoom> oh?
22:27 -!- Urby [~urbantus2@urbantus.gotadsl.co.uk] has joined #buncs
22:27 < NanakiXII> got a C
22:27 <@NeilOfDoom> that's ok
22:28 < NanakiXII> thats crap
22:28 < NanakiXII> and because of bloody stupid economics mark scheme i got a b in that
22:28 < NanakiXII> despite having the most marks in the class, when 2 people got A's
22:29 < NanakiXII> just 'cos i got a lower mark on one of the papers than the "A" threshold
22:29 <@NeilOfDoom> and this is my point with qualifications
22:29 <@NeilOfDoom> they're unfair :)
22:29 < NanakiXII> well it was dumb
22:29 < NanakiXII> if i got a special commendation on the essay paper how can i get a B?
22:30 <@NeilOfDoom> because it's silly
22:30 <@NeilOfDoom> heard the government wants to scrap 6th forms?
22:30 <@NeilOfDoom> and just have colleges?
22:30 < NanakiXII> o.o no
22:31 < NanakiXII> that would piss my dad off
22:31 <@NeilOfDoom> why?
22:31 < NanakiXII> he's a teacher who teaches 90% sixth form
22:31 <@NeilOfDoom> heh
22:32 <@NeilOfDoom> it's not the education minister who wants to do it
22:32 <@NeilOfDoom> it's someone else but I forget who
22:32 <@NeilOfDoom> there was a thing in The Times about it
22:32 < NanakiXII> that would be worse. you'd be forced to change schools again
22:32 < NanakiXII> i think less people would go
22:32 <@NeilOfDoom> meant to get better grades on average
22:32 <@NeilOfDoom> and be cheaper for the government

00:33 <+Evo> divs really aren't that different to tables I suppose
00:33 <+Evo> but web browsers differ in their support for them

22:48 <@draq> Xiven: are you PHP pages "secure"
22:48 <@draq> ?
22:48 <@Xiven> which php pages?
22:49 <@draq> well, at the debconf, a group of peeps went on a diatribe about how crap PHP pages were
22:49 <@draq> main reasons were citing security
22:50 <@draq> PHP tech, not the pages sorry
22:50 <@Xiven> ah
22:50 <@draq> wondered what your opinion was
22:50 <@draq> or exp
22:52 <@Xiven> i have no opinion since i am no security expert
22:52 <@Xiven> i have no doubt that PHP has security holes
22:52 -!- UrBantus [~urbantus@cAK-UrBantus.users.quakenet.org] has quit [Signed off]
22:52 <@Xiven> I would imagine that PHP is less secure than say perl, because a) perl's been around longer and b) PHP tries to do everything which always means it's going to be more likely to have some flaw somewhere
22:57 <@Xiven> but that's just a random guess

23:46 <@Xiven> ah
23:47 <@Xiven> registered globals
23:47 <@Xiven> any moron knows to turn that off
23:47 <@draq> That's something I did not know
23:50 <@Xiven> basically if it's on, then any post, get or cookie variables get put into variables automatically

21:20 < gCje`> cos they dont pick as much stuff up
21:20 < Kitty_N> and superglue isn't as good for sticking that worm back together

18:17 <+Dax> You want the PVR
18:17 <@draq> but Hauppauge DEC 2000-T (Digital Entertainment Center) (Add £92.00) can decode Digital TV?

21:52 <@draq> Xiven: my question was more why the kids aren't running a firewall
21:53 <@Xiven> because 99% of internet users don't know what a firewall is
21:53 <@draq> I must be mental to not only run linux, but I also run a firewall :)
21:53 <@Xiven> now don't ask me about gwief, kam and cosmo, i've already disowned them :)
21:54 <@draq> heh
21:54 <@draq> Hixie: you there?
21:54 < Kamakaze> ive been running this install of windows for 2 years
21:54 <@draq> Xiven: how is the job front?
21:54 <@draq> Kamakaze: upgrade your warez :)
21:54 < Kamakaze> and this is the first virus i have had
21:54 <@Xiven> same as always
21:54 < Kamakaze> bar those we get from you
21:54 < Kamakaze> if i recall your machine used to be covered in the buggers back at buncs
21:54 <@draq> i've had an STD :O
21:55 <@draq> Kamakaze: so? i get around :)
21:55 <@Xiven> did we really want to know that?
21:55 <@draq> I caught it off a dirty bed
21:55 <@draq> I hope
21:55 <@Xiven> gross
21:55 <@draq> That's Russia for you

00:54 <@draq> NoVisAnima: fantastic landscape
00:55 <@draq> I saw Mount Blanc from a plane while flying to Bologna in Italy from Paris. Totally amazing
00:55 <@NoVisAnima> seeing mont blanc while paragliding was rather good
00:56 <@NoVisAnima> being up in those mountains meant that it was cooler than it could have been
00:57 <@draq> I miss mountains. The Ice Age has flattened has Finland!

23:20 < NanakiXII> GRRR
23:20 < NanakiXII> i had just got that out of my head
23:20 <@NoVisAnima> ha ha
23:21  * NoVisAnima uses the power of loud music to get rubbish out of his head
23:21 <@NoVisAnima> though i wonder how long i've got to enjoy this properly, before the neighbours come back
23:22 < NanakiXII> dambit
23:22 < NanakiXII> *nit
23:22 < NanakiXII> if i dream about badgers and mushrooms i am blaming you
23:22 < NanakiXII> last night i had a weeeird dream
23:22 <@NoVisAnima> ooh?
23:24 < NanakiXII> i dreamt that all of us atg lived in this place by the sea shore that was kinda like an oil rig
23:24 < NanakiXII> except it was on shore
23:24 < NanakiXII> and i had to go outside, and to get to the beach you had to walk through this weird glass walkway..except the floor was made of clear plastic stuff that was bouncy, and the sea was right underneath
23:25 < NanakiXII> so i walked on it and it was weird, and then i went down a slope, and natalie told me to hurry up so i ran and i slipped and slid down the slope and i was thinking OMG i can't get my clothes wet!
23:25 < NanakiXII> and i landed up on the edge of this cliff which was the beach, and it was evening
23:25 < NanakiXII> and i looked out to see and thought "damnit, this is going to be another tidal wave dream...but i've realised it's a dream so i'll just make a tidal wave not happen"
23:26 < NanakiXII> and so i crawled bit by bit up the slope always looking out to sea for a tidal wave to come, and i got to the top and natalie and simon were there, and i was just about to say "phew, no wave" and one great big wall of water came off the LAND and woke me up
23:27 <@NoVisAnima> i'm sure that's got to mean something right...
23:27 <@NeilOfDoom> yeah it means someone needs therapy
23:28 < NanakiXII> wooo now i have a different song in my head
23:28 <@NeilOfDoom> oh I can fix that
23:28 <@NeilOfDoom> badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger
23:28 <@NeilOfDoom> badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom
23:28 < NanakiXII> ATOP!
23:28 < NanakiXII> *STOP even
23:28 <@NeilOfDoom> hehe
23:28 < NanakiXII> Blehhh
23:28 < NanakiXII> I wanted to put a forum on my site, and now two of the admins on it have had a massive "go" saying i shouldn't
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> why not?
23:29 < NanakiXII> because they think there are already too many
23:30 < NanakiXII> and i "didn't ask them"
23:30 < NanakiXII> and they think i am doing it on the basis of 7 people out of 11 in a poll saying yes
23:31 < NanakiXII> grrrr
23:31 <@NoVisAnima> ~:/
23:32 < NanakiXII> and i bought a domain for it too
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> i would have to say it's a little foolish to buy things ahead of time
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> i've lost quite a bit of money along those lines
23:33 < NanakiXII> well its ok i can still use the domani
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> obviously
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> but it's not being put to it's inital use
23:34 < NanakiXII> i can host my personal siteon it
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> good plan
23:34 < NanakiXII> at least i didnt pay for hosting
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> that would be a mistake
23:34 < NanakiXII> but if i had known it wouldnt be used for cosplay forum i wouldve bought kamineko.co.uk instead
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> aaw
23:49 <@NoVisAnima> hmm, me and mark were discussing what we're doing regarding BUNCS. We came to the conclusion that we need someone who can a) make a website look nice  b) make nice looking flyers because we can do neither
23:52 < NanakiXII> i can do flyers
23:52 < NanakiXII> sort of
23:52 <@aeronic^> if you want hosting - www.uk2.net for domain, and www.3dpixelnet.com for hosting
23:52 <@aeronic^> works out about £20 for the year
23:53 <@aeronic^> oh NanakiXII, and they let you have forums
23:53 <@aeronic^> oh, and my mate runs it
23:53 <@aeronic^> s/runs/owns/ 
23:53 <@GwieF_> if you can't find anyone else you could try to get Kam todo the website...though it will probably end up covered in pokemon or some other freaky crap :p
23:54 <@Kamakaze> or a snoopy
23:54 <@GwieF_> snoopys are fine
23:55 < NanakiXII> pokemon rocks
23:56 <@NoVisAnima> yes but, somehow i think having pokemon all over the place might be a little wrong
23:57 <@NoVisAnima> and NanakiXII do i take that as an offer to do the flyers ~:/
23:59 < NanakiXII> um...pwerhaps
--- Day changed Fri Sep 19 2003
00:03 <@NoVisAnima> \o/
00:04 <@Kamakaze> nanaki should be on the comittee as the token female
00:05 < NanakiXII> oi
00:06 <@Kamakaze> you are female arent you?
00:06 < NanakiXII> i'm not being anyone's token female
00:06 <@NoVisAnima> aaw
00:06 <@Kamakaze> then you could get more female members =)
00:07 <@Kamakaze> or perhaps if we played barbies pet rescue, more would come along =)
00:07 <@NoVisAnima> lol
00:07 < NanakiXII> i know
00:07 < NanakiXII> i'll come along to the stall in my kitty n outfit
00:07 < NanakiXII> like they have the scantily clad females at ects and stuff
00:08 <@NoVisAnima> mmm yes that'd work
00:08 <@aeronic^> hah
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> well in all truth we do need more people... just so someone can run the soc next year
00:09 < NanakiXII> hee
00:09 < NanakiXII> maybe that would get bcss members too
00:09 < NanakiXII> i can just chase around all the geeks
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> and scare them off
00:10 < NanakiXII> no
00:10 < NanakiXII> and embarass them into signing up
00:10 < NanakiXII> actually i think i would be too embarassed
00:10 < NanakiXII> cosplaying around anime freaks is different to cosplaying around normals
00:11 < NanakiXII> i'd just feel like a twat
00:11 <@Kamakaze> get all the buncs commitee to dress up
00:11 <@NoVisAnima> well it would look rather foolish you have to admit
00:11 < NanakiXII> and there's no way i'm bringing lulu, she's far too heavy
00:11 <@NoVisAnima> i think just having a projector running will bring people like last yera
00:11 <@Kamakaze> as people from soul calibur
00:11 <@Kamakaze> with really big swords
00:11 <@NoVisAnima> well we dont need much dressing up
00:12 <@NoVisAnima> flo looks almost identical to one of them
00:12 < NanakiXII> sophitia?
00:12 <@NoVisAnima> the spanish fencer
00:12 <@NoVisAnima> raphael
00:12 < NanakiXII> damn
00:12 < NanakiXII> he would look so sexy in a breastplate and a short white skirt
00:12 <@NoVisAnima> no i am going to ignore that
00:13 <@NoVisAnima> i'm not going to accept that you put the idea of flo and sexy in the same sentance
00:14 <@NoVisAnima> i think i'm going to have to have a little lie down
00:14  * NanakiXII starts singing "seeexxxxyyyyy! everything about flo is so seeexxxyyyy"
00:15 <@NoVisAnima> aaghh
00:15 <@NoVisAnima> you obviously are dying to see him again
00:16 < NanakiXII> i can't wait
00:16 < NanakiXII> he reminds me of a goat
00:16 <@NoVisAnima> hehee
00:16 < NanakiXII> i only just realised it
00:16 <@Kamakaze> you find goats sexy?
00:16 < NanakiXII> it's the beard
00:17 <@NoVisAnima> you never know flo might look different when he comes back
00:17 < NanakiXII> he might look like a sheep?
00:17 < NanakiXII> i won't answer that question kam
00:18 <@NoVisAnima> sheep would be a new look
00:18 <@NoVisAnima> wouldn't make him any better really
00:18 < NanakiXII> sheep would be an afro
00:19 <@NoVisAnima> i know
00:19 <@NoVisAnima> there was one at school, a definate sheep
00:21 <@NoVisAnima> knowing my luck flo is probably going to be even more annoying than he was last yera
00:22 <@Kamakaze> he might come back opposite sex
00:22 <@aeronic^> possible ?
00:22 <@NoVisAnima> oh there's room for flo to be worse
00:23 <@NoVisAnima> he could spend more time not just hiding in his room
00:24 <@NoVisAnima> but kam flo as the opposite sex...i dont want to consider what that'd look like
00:25 < NanakiXII> i'm just glad you dont have to do your dissertation in groups
00:25 < NanakiXII> i think if flo was in my group for something again....bad things would happen
00:26 <@NoVisAnima> to whom?
00:26 < NanakiXII> all concerned
00:26 <@NoVisAnima> i wouldn't worry
00:26 <@NoVisAnima> he's bound not to get in your way
00:27 <@NoVisAnima> no one could be that unlucky
00:27 < NanakiXII> dont chance it
00:28 <@NoVisAnima> i'm sure flo would choose the more interesting / academic modules
00:28 <@NoVisAnima> that being his nature
00:29 < NanakiXII> OHOOOOOO
00:29 < NanakiXII> are you saying i am doing mickey mouse modules? EH? ARE YOU!!?!?!?!
00:29 <@NoVisAnima> i'm just rephrasing what you've said yourself
00:30 < NanakiXII> nice dodge.....8/10
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> though you did choose to do the lisp module
00:31 < NanakiXII> yup

00:33 <@aeronic^> im not very good at explaining myself
00:33 <@NoVisAnima> (very good at increasing line count though)
00:33 <@aeronic^> who cares about line count :)
00:34 <@NoVisAnima> not me
00:34 < NanakiXII> i think i am getting obsessed with lulu
00:34 <@aeronic^> so is it called tron then
00:34 <@aeronic^> or likely
00:34 <@NoVisAnima> i would hasten to agree

00:35 <@Kamakaze> seeing dead ones is more common than living ones
00:36 < NanakiXII> oh, i've seen a living one
00:36 < NanakiXII> it was on the hockey pitch!
00:36 <@NoVisAnima> i've seen a living family
00:36 < NanakiXII> we had to move it before we could play
00:36 <@NoVisAnima> it was in our lean to
00:36 <@NoVisAnima> a mother and her 3 little baby hedgehogs

00:36 <@Kamakaze> hedgehogs are great
00:37 <@aeronic^> oh ffs
00:37 <@aeronic^> that doesnt work
00:37 <@NoVisAnima> NanakiXII: so long as you dont get so obsessed with lulu that you start getting intersted in that final fuck video
00:37 < NanakiXII> O___O you looked at it? did it have lulu in it?
00:37 <@Kamakaze> i would say, thats "pitch black, the video game"
00:37 < NanakiXII> omg don't tell me you bought it :P
00:37 <@NoVisAnima> no i didn't
00:37 <@aeronic^> yes
00:37 <@aeronic^> so it appears
00:38 <@aeronic^> shitty thing
00:38 <@aeronic^> :)
00:38 < NanakiXII> i'm so excited about being lulu i have even grown my nails!
00:38 <@NoVisAnima> does grown nails mean not bit them?
00:38 < NanakiXII> yes
00:38 < NanakiXII> i've been trying to not bite my nails for about 5 years now
00:38 < NanakiXII> and it's finally worked
00:38 <@aeronic^> if anyone has family guy series3 dvd, its on the 4th ep
00:38 <@aeronic^> :)
00:39 <@aeronic^> NanakiXII, ive been trying to not bite nails for the last 15 years
00:39 <@aeronic^> and still fail
00:39 < NanakiXII> well
00:39 < NanakiXII> just cosplay lulu!
00:39 <@aeronic^> no
00:39 < NanakiXII> but it works!
00:39 <@NoVisAnima> i've managed to cut down the frequency of my nail bighting
00:39 <@Kamakaze> doesnt that video player have screen shot capabilities?
00:39 < NanakiXII> well to be honest it's OK for blokes to bite their nails but on girlies it looks really icky
00:39 <@aeronic^> dunno
00:39 <@NoVisAnima> i now only do it about once a fortnight
00:39 <@Kamakaze> power dvd does
00:39 <@aeronic^> its a .ogg
00:40 <@aeronic^> you dont think i actually bought the dvd
00:40 <@aeronic^> :)
00:40 <@Kamakaze> ogg video?
00:40 <@Kamakaze> power dvd can play video files
00:40 <@NoVisAnima> you know that power dvd can play vid files
00:40 <@aeronic^> yea
00:40 <@aeronic^> with a .ogg wrapper?
00:40 <@Kamakaze> if its installed as a codec
00:40 <@aeronic^> ok
00:40 <@NoVisAnima> it should work
00:40 <@aeronic^> :)
00:40 <@aeronic^> oh well its not that iimportant
00:40 <@aeronic^> nn
00:40 <@aeronic^> :)
00:40 <@aeronic^> tis late and i have lecture in morning
00:41 <@aeronic^> im in school on monday
00:41 <@aeronic^> start of teaching practise
00:41 <@NoVisAnima> what are you doing again
00:41 <@aeronic^> teaching
00:41 <@Kamakaze> teaching who
00:41 <@aeronic^> schoolkids
00:41 <@aeronic^> maths
00:41 <@Kamakaze> hah!
00:41 <@aeronic^> secondary
00:41 <@Kamakaze> good luck =0
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> good luck indeed
00:42 <@aeronic^> why
00:42 <@aeronic^> im in hull
00:42 <@aeronic^> its a 'lovely' city
00:42 <@aeronic^> no rough schools at all
00:42 <@aeronic^> COUGGGGGGGGGH
00:42 <@Kamakaze> they are kids
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> you are teaching them maths
00:42 <@Kamakaze> doesnt matter where they are from!
00:42 <@aeronic^> im pheering the school with 6% GCSEs
00:42 <@aeronic^> cf your school?
00:42 <@aeronic^> my old school had 60%
00:43 <@aeronic^> hopefully ill get into teaching alevel
00:43 <@aeronic^> since most teachers are incompetent
00:43 <@aeronic^> yet i can actually do the stuff
00:43 <@aeronic^> :)
00:43 <@Kamakaze> a level should be ok to teach
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> so long as you can teach
00:43 <@aeronic^> ofc
00:43 <@aeronic^> :)
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> and not just know stuff
00:43 <@Kamakaze> most of the ppl u get would have actually chosen the subject!
00:43 <@aeronic^> i know lots
00:43 <@Kamakaze> unless its business studies
00:43 <@aeronic^> anyway, bed time
00:44 <@NoVisAnima> nn aeronic^
00:45 <@NoVisAnima> *shudder* years and years of listening to my parents grumbling about teaching (public sector) has put me off 
00:45 <@NoVisAnima> oddly though my sister has been put in the opposite mood and really really wants to teach

01:20 <@Kamakaze> lol
01:20 <@Kamakaze> you could buy one
01:20 <@Kamakaze> then take back 5 minutes later
01:20 <@Kamakaze> saying you thought it was an n-gage
01:21 <@NoVisAnima> hmm

21:17 <@Kamakaze> he had a mouse friend
21:17 <@PeglegNeil> seriously?

21:19 <@PeglegNeil> I don't think anyone's likely to stalk me
21:19 < NanakiXII> Hm...
21:19 <@PeglegNeil> and also I tend to plaster my name over everything I do because it helps job-hunting prospects
21:19 <@LongJohnNovis> but NanakiXII on the other hand...
21:19 < NanakiXII> with subdomains, where do you upload the files? do you have to set up a redirection?
21:19 < NanakiXII> like i just created http://nana.cosplay.me.uk
21:20 < NanakiXII> and where would i upload stuff for that
21:20 <@PeglegNeil> NanakiXII :: depends on the hosting
21:20 < NanakiXII> o.o
21:20 <@PeglegNeil> ftp.neilwakefield.com and neilwakefield.com resolve to the same IP for me
21:20 <@PeglegNeil> so I just ftp to neilwakefield.com and upload there
21:20 < NanakiXII> nonononono
21:20 < NanakiXII> i use ftp.cosplay.me.uk 
21:20 < NanakiXII> but that wasnt the question
21:21 < NanakiXII> i mean...if i type in http://nana.cosplay.me.uk where will it look for the index file?
21:21 <@Kamakaze> where ever it has been told to look
21:21 < NanakiXII> because surely it should be different to if i type http://www.cosplay.me.uk
21:21 < NanakiXII> right. so does that mean i want to set up a redirection?
21:21 <@Kamakaze> i dont know
21:21 < NanakiXII> O_O
21:21 <@Kamakaze> i dont know where its been told to look
21:21 < NanakiXII> well how do i know that?
21:22 <@Kamakaze> our host would make us a directory for each domain and subdomain
21:22 <@PeglegNeil> NanakiXII :: did you just buy the domain?
21:22 <@PeglegNeil> or did you get it through your hosting?
21:22 < NanakiXII> ahaaa
21:22 < NanakiXII> no, i bought it but changed the nameservers to the hosting thingybob
21:22 <@PeglegNeil> if you got it through the hosting then it'll be set to something like http://yourhostingcompany/~yourusername
21:22 < NanakiXII> it's OK
21:22 < NanakiXII> i've got it
21:22 <@PeglegNeil> ah ok
21:22 < NanakiXII> it created the directory nana for me

21:25 <@Kamakaze> i see
21:25 <@LongJohnNovis> it took me ages to get that fsking gold code in
21:25 <@Kamakaze> i might know someone with a gba
21:25 <@Kamakaze> he has a gamecube
21:25 <@LongJohnNovis> trust me it would make it much easier
21:25 <@Kamakaze> so its not a great leap that he might have a gba
21:26 < NanakiXII> WHAT THE
21:26 < NanakiXII> i didn't ask this stupid ftp thing to upload my software project
21:26 <@LongJohnNovis> LOL
21:26 < NanakiXII> ~_______~

21:28 <@LongJohnNovis> chocolate cake...
21:28 <@LongJohnNovis> neeooooooo
21:28 <@Kamakaze> have u found out in what way the stuff carries over from the previous game?
21:32 <@LongJohnNovis> it says in the manual "you can update the code at any point in the game until your party meets up with issac"
21:32 <@LongJohnNovis> and there are 2 pages of djinn
21:32 <@Kamakaze> so you meet up with your other characters
21:32 <@LongJohnNovis> that would seem to be the case
21:33 <@Kamakaze> the thing is that if they are level 99
21:33 <@Kamakaze> i take it they dont actually fight 
21:33 <@LongJohnNovis> no
21:33 <@Kamakaze> or at least not like right to the end
21:33 <@Kamakaze> it would be funny if you had to fight them
21:33 <@LongJohnNovis> the higher their levels apparently makes teh game easier
21:33 <@LongJohnNovis> oh and the save file (i'm guessing)  is larger because it takes longer to save the games
21:33 <@LongJohnNovis> it's not instant
21:34 <@Kamakaze> thats what im worried about, the game being too easy because of my carried over data
21:34 <@LongJohnNovis> i'm not too conscerned my chars were only lvl 24
21:34 <@LongJohnNovis> and other parts of the game world are open to people who know
21:34 <@LongJohnNovis> and things understand that you've been through the game
21:35 <@Kamakaze> so i guess i should play it thru without my previous data aswell then =)
21:35 <@LongJohnNovis> i dont believe it's worth it TBH
21:36 <@LongJohnNovis> what you miss are people giong "do you know what happened last time"
21:39 <@LongJohnNovis> oh and the world map is slightly less useful as it zooms out a little too much to see where things are (the world is bigger)
21:40 <@Kamakaze> does it automatically make ppl attack the next thing if what u were going to attack is killed?
21:40 <@LongJohnNovis> nope
21:41 <@Kamakaze> dang
21:41 <@Kamakaze> thats really annoying =)
21:41 <@LongJohnNovis> i know my way around it
21:41 <@LongJohnNovis> predicting when things are going to die..
21:41 <@LongJohnNovis> apparently the summons are bigger, and you can mix elements
21:41 <@LongJohnNovis> \o/
21:42 <@Kamakaze> well i'll find out next week
21:43 <@LongJohnNovis> ~:0
21:43 <@LongJohnNovis> i really want a gb player to play it properly

22:27 <@draq> Hixie__: Ian must know :)
22:28 <@draq> I should sleep
22:29 <@draq> What percent is $168m of a $43Bil fortune?
22:29 <@draq> http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3127040.stm
22:30 <@NoVisAnima> just more than petty cash
22:31 <@draq> Is 1000m = 1bil?
22:33 < aeronic^> yup
22:33 <@NoVisAnima> unless you are using the queen's english
22:34 < ChocoJon> huh
22:34 < ChocoJon> ?
22:34 < ChocoJon> I thought that 1000 million = 1 billion
22:34 <@NoVisAnima> american
22:35 < NanakiXII> yeah its different
22:35 < ChocoJon> ok - so what's the english version then?
22:35 <@NoVisAnima> 1 billion = one hundred thousand million x 10
22:35 < ChocoJon> i.e. 1 million * 1 million?
22:35 <@NoVisAnima> yup
22:36 < ChocoJon> any particular reason for that difference?
22:36 <@NoVisAnima> maybe the americans like goals that are easier to attain
22:37 <@NoVisAnima> i dunno
22:37 <@NoVisAnima> there just is a different
22:37 < ChocoJon> oh
22:37 < ChocoJon> ok

17:54 < Kamakaze> lol
17:54 < Kamakaze> and does it do anything useful
17:55 <@NeilOfDoom> Kamakaze :: don't ask silly questions
17:56 <@NeilOfDoom> I just wanted to try out the netwide assembler
17:56 < Kamakaze> lol
17:56 < Kamakaze> does it do it for the gba?
17:57 <@NeilOfDoom> uh no?
17:57 < Kamakaze> then whats the point of doing assembler then =)
17:57 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
17:57 <@NeilOfDoom> Kamakaze :: when you need to hand optimise time-critical functions
17:58 < Kamakaze> but why are you doing such silly things =)
17:58 <@NeilOfDoom> for fun?
17:58 < Kamakaze> just tell them to get a faster computer
17:58 <@NeilOfDoom> I had an interview at lionhead yesterday, \o/
17:58 < Kamakaze> cool
17:58 <@NeilOfDoom> won't know for a week or so whether or not I got the job though
17:58 < Kamakaze> have u seen that 4 uk universitys are getting gamecube dev kits
17:58 <@NoVisAnima> yup
17:59 <@NeilOfDoom> *shrug*
17:59 <@NeilOfDoom> they're horrible things
17:59 <@NeilOfDoom> they look like someone went on a shopping spree at Maplins
17:59 <@NeilOfDoom> you can buy third-party dev kits for around £600
18:00 <@NeilOfDoom> http://www.snsys.com/GameCube/SN-TDEV.htm
18:00 <@NoVisAnima> IIRC SN were supplying the dev kits
18:02 <@NeilOfDoom> ah yeah then
18:02 <@NeilOfDoom> I know someone at one of the unis getting one
18:03 <@NeilOfDoom> I want a ps2 dev kit, they're fun
18:05 <@NoVisAnima> howso?
18:06 <@NeilOfDoom> NoVisAnima :: do you know how the PS2's VUs work?
18:06 <@NoVisAnima> no
18:06 <@NeilOfDoom> ok, you basically have two instruction pipelines and they're synchronised
18:07 < Kamakaze> it sounds like NeilOfDoom meant "fun"
18:07 <@NeilOfDoom> you could do a mul on one that could take a few cycles, then do a few small ops on the the other one, then get both results and carry on
18:07 <@NeilOfDoom> it's basically asm taken to a really bizarre level
18:07 <@NoVisAnima> oooh
18:07 <@NoVisAnima> smashing
18:07 <@NeilOfDoom> it's *proper* console programming :)

21:56 <@NoVisAnima> yeah westwood is fine
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> remember to clean the loo
21:56 < endeavour> and in the room numbers... is the first number an indication of the floor>?
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> depends
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> for quary / mendip it did
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> but others it meant something else
21:56 < endeavour> durhill
21:56 < endeavour> are some room groups no smoking?
21:56 < endeavour> just curious as to why it had a no smoking option on the form, but in the book it says only kitchens are no smoking
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> urm
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> the whole place is non smoking ...
21:56 < endeavour> oh good :)
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> the rooms have smoke detectors
21:56 < endeavour> perhaps they ought to reprint the brochure then
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> which go off if someone smokes
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> the kitchens you *could* smoke in them
21:56 <@NoVisAnima> but well that's where the non smoking and smoking comes in i suppose
21:57 < endeavour> stupid brochure then
21:57 < endeavour> it says, and I quote:
21:57 < endeavour> Polden Court is a completely non-smoking zone; this ban extends to
21:57 < endeavour> study bedrooms and communal areas. Elsewhere smoking is allowed only
21:57 < endeavour> in residents study bedrooms.
21:57 <@NoVisAnima> well in quarry (at least) there were smoke detectors in the room
21:58 <@NoVisAnima> and they told you not to put socks over them, to smoke
21:58 < endeavour> well I don't smoke
21:58 < endeavour> was just wondering why it had the option, then says you can smoke anyway in the brochure
21:59 <@NoVisAnima> to give smokers hope
21:59 < endeavour> i see
21:59 < endeavour> :P
21:59 <@NoVisAnima> or put them all together
21:59 <@NoVisAnima> so they can go find somewhere 'else' to smoke as a group
22:01 < endeavour> any tips on what I'm likely to forget to take with me
22:01 <@NoVisAnima> underwear?
22:01 < endeavour> don't think I'll forget that
22:01 < endeavour> :P
22:01 <@NoVisAnima> computer cables (mainly power)
22:02 <@NoVisAnima> something critical
22:02 < endeavour> probably
22:02 <@NoVisAnima> ooh something you are *bound* to forget: your bathstudent username
22:03 < endeavour> being the sad person that I am I setup the VPN connection to test it
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> just remember if you *do* all the socs you join *will* come and poke you repeatedly
22:03 < endeavour> so i can find it in control panel anyway
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> ah
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> that's your bath username
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> your bathstudent username is a different thing
22:03 < endeavour> oh right
22:03 < endeavour> yeah thats just my surname
22:03 <@NoVisAnima> hense why many people keep on forgetting >_<
22:04 < endeavour> not much worth looking at on bathstudent anyway
22:04 < endeavour> though i'm dying to know what a Mega Breakfast is
22:04 < endeavour> and how it compares with a Sainsburys Cafe one :P
22:04 <+Dax> oooo novis, do I get my promotion to +ao now pls??
22:06 <@NoVisAnima> after the 9th
22:06 <@NoVisAnima> ie after you've signed up again
22:07 <+Dax> signed up?
22:07 < endeavour> gah
22:07 < endeavour> What happened to the pitstop online sandwich ordering?
22:07 <@NoVisAnima> for BUNCS
22:07 <+Dax> oh looooool
22:07 < endeavour> was looking forward to trying that out
22:07 <@NoVisAnima> dont ask me
22:07 <@NoVisAnima> they did a complete change around of the food systems this year
22:08 <@NoVisAnima> you never know choices might have become edible...
22:08 < endeavour> So is BUNCS going to be at the societies fair?
22:09 <@NoVisAnima> yes
22:09 <@NoVisAnima> we are a society
22:09 <@NoVisAnima> it's how we get our fundign
22:09 < endeavour> what do you need funding for?
22:09 < endeavour> do they charge you to rent rooms out?
22:09 <@NoVisAnima> we need funding because
22:10 <@NoVisAnima> we have to look like we know what we are doing
22:10 <@NoVisAnima> and it costs money to photocopy things
22:10 < endeavour> is it usual to take a printer to uni?
22:10 < endeavour> I sort of assumed there were ones available in the library
22:10 <@NoVisAnima> there are
22:10 < endeavour> but this UCAS booklet seems to think its essential to take your own
22:11 <@NoVisAnima> i just *love* those 2 hour queues near cwk handin
22:11 <@NoVisAnima> having a printer is definately an advantage
22:11 < endeavour> lol
22:12 < endeavour> i'll see how things go before I fork out for one
22:12 <@NoVisAnima> ah
22:12 <@NoVisAnima> dont go to the effort just for uni
22:12 <@NoVisAnima> just do things 1 day early
22:12 < endeavour> I've already been conned into £35 for a freshers week pass
22:12 <@NoVisAnima> only natural
22:13 < endeavour> most of which seems to consist of RSPCA visits
22:13 < endeavour> from reading bathstudent.com
22:13 <@NoVisAnima> it's ~£60
22:13 <@NoVisAnima> for internet
22:13 < endeavour> £85
22:14 < endeavour> I've been mugged
22:14 < endeavour> says no file sharing either
22:14 <@NoVisAnima> naturally

23:29 <@draq> I just want to use some one elses
23:34 < endeavour> back
23:34 < endeavour> dreamweaver comes with some sample css's
23:34 < endeavour> or you could steal some from someone elses website
23:34 -!- InvaderNovis is now known as NoVisAnima
23:34 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
23:34 < endeavour> does mean you'll have to build your website around their tags though
23:35 < Lulu`> hee hee hee
23:35 < Lulu`> i remember once stealing someone's stylesheet with a class called "post"
23:35 <@NoVisAnima> ~:o
23:35 < Lulu`> I thought you *had* to call that class (for td) post, so i called it that in every stylesheet ever since
23:36 < Lulu`> even when i figured out what a dumbass i was
23:36  * NoVisAnima quietly points and laughs at Lulu`
23:36 < endeavour> honestly...
23:36 < endeavour> bathstudent.com are spamming me about NUS tuition fee protests
23:36 < endeavour> and if you click the link in the email it says 'Access Denied'
23:36 < endeavour> what's the point of that
23:37 < Lulu`> i hate receiving mail from nusonline because it always comes in nice attachments...which the university webmail won't let you open
23:37 < Lulu`> so it just gets deleted straight away
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> i dont use uni webmail
23:37 < endeavour> Outlook 2003 is nice
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> because i want to make sure my computer is as insecure as posible
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> so i use outlook express
23:37 < Lulu`> i do because i can't be arsed to configure outlook
23:37 <@NoVisAnima> now that is lazy
23:38 < endeavour> only think with outlook
23:38 < endeavour> is its so hard to backup everything
23:38 <@NoVisAnima> you complain about bucs not clicking 5 times for your sql database
23:38 < endeavour> I mean god only knows where Outlook stores its address book
23:38 <@NoVisAnima> and yet you dont bother to do 4 clicks for outlook
23:38 < endeavour> some place inside the registry i imagine
23:38 <@NoVisAnima> *sigh*
23:38 <@NoVisAnima> kids these days
23:38 < WarAtWar> On XP it keeps it in your local settings I think.
23:38 < endeavour> they just don't get scared like the used to
23:38 < WarAtWar> Or that may just be mail.
23:39 < endeavour> its just mail
23:39 < endeavour> and the 'Rules & Filters' are stored somewhere else
23:39 < endeavour> as is the calendar
23:39 < WarAtWar> Blah.
23:39 <@NoVisAnima> i had a problem with outlook 2003
23:39 <@NoVisAnima> it kept saying there was a registry problem
23:40 <@NoVisAnima> so i kept with express
23:40 < endeavour> I'm intruiged as to how the Office 2003 Beta pack was 15 cds
23:40 < endeavour> and the Office 2003 final is apparently just a single CD
23:40 < endeavour> that's some compression they've got going on there
23:40 <@NoVisAnima> lack of compression
23:40 < endeavour> probably just took out all the clipart
23:41 <@NoVisAnima> multiple versions
23:41 <@NoVisAnima> M$ pr0n?

16:57 < WarAtWar> Aerospace engineering.
16:58 < endeavour> cool
16:59 < endeavour> I'm also starting at Bath on tuesday (Maths)
16:59 < WarAtWar> Which of the halls are you in?
16:59 < endeavour> westwood
17:00 < endeavour> yourself?
17:00 < WarAtWar> I'll be over in Norwood, up on the 7th floor I think ¬_¬.
17:00 < endeavour> I think I'm on 5th floor, assuming the first number in the room no is a floor number
17:01 < endeavour> so where abouts are you now?
17:01 < WarAtWar> Still at home :P.
17:01 <@NoVisAnima> but norwood gets a lift... where as westood doesn't
17:01 < endeavour> norwood is noisy though
17:01 < endeavour> according to unofficial-guides.com anyhow
17:01 < WarAtWar> Yeah, that's a plus. I didn't fancy lugging all my computer kit up all the flights of stairs.
17:02 <@NoVisAnima> heh i did that
17:02 <@NoVisAnima> lvl 4
17:02 <@NoVisAnima> lugging this blasted monitor up and down for the LANs
17:02 < endeavour> damn
17:02 < endeavour> forgot about that
17:02 < endeavour> got a full tower as well
17:02 < WarAtWar> Same here.
17:03 <@NoVisAnima> well for transport around there are trolleys
17:03 < endeavour> was going to get a midi tower before I leave, but decided £50 could be better spent elsewhere
17:03 < WarAtWar> Monitors the heavy and awkward bit.
17:03 <@NoVisAnima> size?
17:03 < endeavour> monitors ok, got a TFT :)
17:03 < WarAtWar> 19".
17:03 < endeavour> even got the original box in the loft
17:03 <@NoVisAnima> heh same here
17:04 < WarAtWar> http://homepages.tesco.net/baird.family/workplace.jpg
17:04 <@NoVisAnima> people are always willing to help get your equipment to and back from the lans anyway
17:04 < endeavour> are you taking a printer?
17:04 < WarAtWar> Unfortunately not.
17:04 < endeavour> same here
17:04 < WarAtWar> Rest of the family need it.
17:05 < WarAtWar> That's pretty much it except for my new speakers.
17:05 < endeavour> when I said whereabouts are you
17:05 < endeavour> I meant location in the UK
17:05 < endeavour> not 'at home' ;P
17:05 < WarAtWar> Worcestershire, near Evesham.
17:05 < WarAtWar> So I'm only like 70 minutes away from Bath.
17:06 < endeavour> ah right
17:06 < endeavour> lucky
17:06 < endeavour> I'm about 3.5 hours away (near cambridge)
17:06 <@NoVisAnima> lucky?
17:06 < endeavour> well lucky in terms of travelling
17:06 <@NoVisAnima> damn it's nice being 3 hours away from home
17:06 <@NoVisAnima> *they* cant pop in
17:06 < endeavour> :P
17:06 < endeavour> true
17:06 < WarAtWar> That's true.
17:06 < WarAtWar> But I think I'm just about far enough away to put off regular visits.
17:06 < endeavour> can't take your washing home as easy though
17:07 < endeavour> tumble dryers are evil
17:07 <@NoVisAnima> meh
17:07 <@NoVisAnima> i do mine own anyway
17:07 < endeavour> shrink all your clothes
17:07 < endeavour> so do I
17:08 <@NoVisAnima> i dont have the option to use a tumble dryer
17:08 < endeavour> how do you do it then?
17:08 < endeavour> have you got a clothes horse in your room?
17:08 <@NoVisAnima> the lounge
17:08 <@NoVisAnima> just infront of the balcony window
17:08 <@NoVisAnima> gets lots of sunlight there

20:30 <@Kam> what are the best file sharing program type things to use that are still "legal"
20:34 <@NoVisAnima> file sharing programs are legal
20:35 <@NoVisAnima> it's just 'what' you share that's illegal
20:35 <@Kam> yeah but some have had law suits against them and such
20:37 <@NoVisAnima> still legal though

17:17 < Lulu> nono
17:17 < Krypt|LTop> LOL
17:17 <@NoVisAnima> all i'd managed to do was get it to go pink instead of red
17:17 < Lulu> i mean this guy pmed me and goes "you have 100mb cable"
17:17 < Lulu> or something
17:17 <@NoVisAnima> 100mb cable... that'd be nice
17:18 <@NoVisAnima> sounds... rather random
17:19 < Krypt|LTop> 100Mbit cat 5e cable?
17:20 < Lulu> look i don't care
17:20 < Lulu> i'm just making a point that it's annoying!
17:20 < Krypt|LTop> i have some, only £50, special price for you sir £45
17:20 <@NoVisAnima> no no no
17:20 <@NoVisAnima> you have to say very special price
17:21 <@NoVisAnima> and spend ages with the customer explaining why this better model for more money is better

17:29 < Krypt|LTop> yep, but I soooo rarely visit
17:29 <@NoVisAnima> well neither do i
17:30 <@NoVisAnima> it was a one off that i spotted it
17:30 <@NoVisAnima> i'm *that* bored
17:30 < Krypt|LTop> i thought "wahay, nothing surprising there, shitty bs.com"
17:31 <@NoVisAnima> heh and you aren't even going to be the one trying to input members into it >_<
17:31 < Krypt|LTop> uhh, get them to type details into pc
17:31 < Krypt|LTop> into txt file or something
17:32 < Krypt|LTop> then you should be able to import lists this year
17:32 <@NoVisAnima> ooh?
17:32 <@NoVisAnima> that'd be handy
17:33 < Krypt|LTop> multiple comma separated username
17:33 < Krypt|LTop> so get them to type into excel
17:33 <@NoVisAnima> 'them'
17:33 < Krypt|LTop> that would be the easiest to get a csv of the usernames form
17:33 < Krypt|LTop> yes, people who want to joing
17:34 <@NoVisAnima> are you saying i should have people actually use the computer i'll have on the stand
17:34 <@NoVisAnima> to sign up
17:34 < Krypt|LTop> maybe, yes
17:34 <@NoVisAnima> i cant see that working right
17:35 <@NoVisAnima> i can see someone deleting the file while i'm not looking
17:35 < Krypt|LTop> bah
17:36 < Krypt|LTop> whatever, saves hours of typing in and guess work as to WTF the stupid fucking idiots meant when they scribbled on the paper
17:37 <@NoVisAnima> i doubt it'll save any time
17:37 < Krypt|LTop> and you can set the ntfs permissions so that it can't be deleted
17:37 < Krypt|LTop> I think it will
17:37 < Krypt|LTop> but whatever
17:37 <@NoVisAnima> ntfs permissions...
17:37 <@NoVisAnima> on a fat 32 hard drive
17:38 <@NoVisAnima> i'd like to see that work
17:38 < Krypt|LTop> doh
17:38 <@NoVisAnima> anyway it would be a read / write file open anyway
17:38 <@NoVisAnima> people can delete stuff
17:38 <@NoVisAnima> i know it

18:15 <@NoVisAnima> i dont bother with that last level
18:15 <@NoVisAnima> it doesn't feel like skill is needed
18:15 <@NoVisAnima> only blind luck
18:17 < aeronic^> xaero is easy :P
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> he might be
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> but he has a habbit of railing me as i spawn and before i've noticed where he is
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> by which time i just spot him to be railed again
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> well that was ages ago
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> got put off by that and haven't played since
18:22 <@GwieF> trying to outrail xaero in a fair rail v rail fight is quite hard.. but all you have todo is stand behind a pillar till he bounces over and you can't lose
18:23 <@NoVisAnima> hehe
18:23 <@Kamakaze> or you cheat and make yourself invincible
18:23 <@NoVisAnima> well i usually cba with finding tricks
18:23 <@NoVisAnima> i beat klesk in a 'fair' rail v rail fight
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> nightmare
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> took the piss
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> my dodgy aim
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> so i camped the rail gun and made sure he never touched it
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> but this is all before i stopped playing anything other than the same map over and over again
18:25 <@NoVisAnima> using q3 only as a way to let off steam
18:25 <@GwieF> imo the most annoying of the bots it sarge... on nightmare his shotgun has rail like accuracy over unlimited range and can kill you with yellow armour in 1 hit... not hard to beat but annoying as hell
18:26 <@GwieF> though that might be because my q3 is slightly screwed :/
18:26 <@NoVisAnima> yeah sarge is a bitch
18:26 <@NoVisAnima> but it was that one who used the lg
18:27 <@NoVisAnima> damn cheating accuracy
18:27 <@NoVisAnima> keep it to hardcore and take the piss
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> which sounds like a fun little diversion right now

19:07 <@NoVisAnima> i swear that's what i've been using it for
19:09 < ChocoJon> of course it is. there'd be another method if we weren't meant to do this, surely?
19:10 <@Kamakaze> yes i have broken it

19:18 <@Kamakaze> do bucs give users php now?
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> i'm going to make a guess that buncs has the smallest comittee for an active society
19:18 <+X_i_Z_o_R> no clue
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> yes you can write in php
19:18 <+endeavour> is choices open on sundays?
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> is choices edible these days?
19:19 <+endeavour> I had a nice curry the other day
19:19 <@NoVisAnima> O_o
19:19 <@NoVisAnima> bloody hell 
19:19 <+endeavour> Though the bloke serving me did refer to chips as vegetables
19:19 <@NoVisAnima> not just edible but "nice"
19:19 <+endeavour> He said "Would you like some vegetables?"
19:19 <+endeavour> I said "Yes please"
19:19 <+endeavour> and he said "Chips ok?"
19:19 <+X_i_Z_o_R> whats wrong with that? :

19:20 <@NoVisAnima> chips and curry is great
19:20 <@NoVisAnima> so long as you dont have rice
19:20 <+endeavour> and rice as well?
19:20 <@Kamakaze> sure
19:20 <+endeavour> I can understand one or the other

23:00 <+Krypt|LTop> NeilOfDoom if there is a company message board then get your new boss to post a message asking if anyone has a room that you can lodge in for 10 days, and you'll pay a reasonable rate
23:00 <+Krypt|LTop> it's probably well worth it

00:11 <@GlimmerMan> the url that set peoples planet to vacation mode was more fun ;)
00:34 <+WarAtWar> Good old Planetarion, that used to be fun.
00:35 <@NeilOfDoom> not any more :)

23:43 < Lulu`> bah
23:43 < Lulu`> i just need a command
23:43 <@NoVisAnima> well

23:44 <@NoVisAnima> http://www.bath.ac.uk/bucs/secure-access/secure-sftp-clients.shtml
23:44 <@NoVisAnima> down the bottom it has info on how to use secure ftp with putty
23:45 < Lulu`> *GRUMBLE*
23:45 <@NoVisAnima> (i use that thing detailed above that looks all gui like)
23:45 < Lulu`> what was wrong with bloody ftp
23:46 <@NoVisAnima> they want security
23:46 < Lulu`> well they'll get it 'cos nobody will actually DO anything
23:46 < Lulu`> since they can't figure out how to use it
23:47 <@NoVisAnima> maybe it's just you
23:47 < Lulu`> maybe it is.
23:47 <@GlimmerMan> u could ftp back in my day
23:47 <@GlimmerMan> ftpgate.bath.ac.uk
23:47 <@NoVisAnima> yeah but as of early this year
23:47 <@NoVisAnima> they turned off telnet and ftp
23:47 <@GlimmerMan> gheyness :(
23:47 <@NoVisAnima> because they are too insecure

19:35 <+Lulu`> a very very long pair of trousers (so long that i was forced to wear the silly shoes which damaged me)
19:35 <+Lulu`> a low cut top that my cousin bought me that i hardly ever wear because it kinda defeats the point of having a low cut top
19:35 <@NeilOfDoom> yes I know what oasis is
19:35 <@aeronic> my sister went and bought  a burburry handbag
19:35 <+Lulu`> and a purse

23:52 < NanakiXII> it's a lie
23:52 < NanakiXII> he probably has a small dick.
23:52 < endeavour> lol
23:52 < endeavour> probably
23:52 < NanakiXII> and feels the need to make up for it :)
23:52 < endeavour> but he did wander in at 6am in the morning

23:52 < NanakiXII> actually that's the bad thing about malekind
23:52 <@NoVisAnima> ah one of them

23:55 < NanakiXII> and get off at saunsburys!
23:55 <@NoVisAnima> 418 = teh r0x0r
23:55 < endeavour> according to my orange bus timetable it only goes to sainsburys on the reverse route from bath spa
23:55 < NanakiXII> or, go into town and get a 10 from the bust station
23:55 <@NoVisAnima> dont be like me and not be able to find sainsburys for a year
23:55 < NanakiXII> oh...yeh
23:55 < NanakiXII> but you can get off near it
23:55 < NanakiXII> like the front entrance
23:55 < endeavour> ok
23:55 < NanakiXII> but if youre on campus its really not worth it
23:55 < NanakiXII> go to waitrose instead, much more lux
23:55 < endeavour> I did find sainsburys in town the other day when i was wandering round
23:56 <@NoVisAnima> NanakiXII: agreed
23:56 < endeavour> just decided I couldn't be bothered to cart my shopping from there to the bus stop
23:56 < NanakiXII> yeh its a pain

00:04 <+endeavour> "God did this in case men because too lazy to have sex."
00:04 <+NanakiXII> ha ha
00:04 <+NanakiXII> more like in case they LUCK OUT
00:04 <@NeilOfDoom> nothing wrong with being lazy
00:04 <+endeavour> "At a pinch, God reasoned, two healthly conscientious men could keep enough females in maternity wards to guarantee the future of the species."
00:04 <@NeilOfDoom> lazy+clever people are responsible for just about every major technological advance

00:08 <+endeavour> lol

00:47 <+NanakiXII> bucs suck

00:51 <+Krypt|LTop> umm, peter, do you rhink you could liase with Kam about the buncs webspace if he is working on it to get us a page with a Java IRC client on htere? It would be much easier to promote the chat room if we just had a javachat page that we could direct people to
00:52 <+Krypt|LTop> there is someone on the resnet forum looking for fellow bath people to play Medal of Honour Allied Assault against/with

16:58 < JanChhbath> hello?
17:00 < JanChhbath> and bye.
17:04 <@draq> Hixie: is it correct to call Arial a webfont ?
17:04 <@Hixie> what's a webfont?
17:05 <+Dax> arial is pretty standard
17:05 < JanChhbath> no idea.
17:05 <@Hixie> "standard"?
17:05 <+Dax> on most systems... but no font is 100% proof
17:05 < JanChhbath> isn't some font with "v" the standard webfont that looks like Aril
17:05 <+Dax> only serif / sans-serif are applicable
17:05 <@Hixie> arial is a font shipped with windows.
17:05 < JanChhbath> arial
17:05 <@Hixie> it's not on other operating systems.
17:06 <+Dax> thats why you need a font list :P
17:09 < JanChhbath> maybe I was thinking about Helvetica but I thought there must be some Arial replacement beginning with "v".
17:11 <@Hixie> Verdana
17:11 <@Hixie> it's not a replacement
17:11 <+Dax> Verdana is m$
17:11 <@Hixie> just another font.
17:11 <@Hixie> Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New are all Microsoft fonts
17:11 <@Hixie> Helvetica, Geneva, Charcoal, are all fonts shipped with Mac
17:11 <+Dax> Verdana is designed for titles anyway... Georgia/Tahoma are for text
17:17 < JanChhbath> and verdana is a Microsfot font? My HTML help told me 4 years ago, that I should better use Verdana because it would be better supported in the internet than the microsoft Windwows font Arial.
17:17 < JanChhbath> Anyways...
17:17 <@draq> Hixie: sorry, was away doing Laundry
17:18 <@Hixie> JanChhbath: your "HTML help" was talking garbage then. :-)
17:18 <@draq> Hixie: So if someone wanted to standardize a style. Would saying everything be "Arial" be fair?
17:18 < JanChhbath> Actually I was just here to ask what you are usually doing here.
17:18 <@Hixie> draq: you mean in CSS?
17:18 <@draq> Hixie: I guess so
17:18 <@Hixie> draq: it would be as fair as saying it should be any other font
17:18 <@Hixie> draq: authors should specify multiple fonts and always give a generic fallback (sans-serif, in this case)
17:18 < JanChhbath> Are you meeting here for playing games?
17:19 <@draq> Hixie: So if someone said that all their corp. webpages should in Acme Inc. Glyph-3 font face, would it be stupid or just as stupid as any other choice?
17:20 <@Hixie> draq: it would be naive, i guess
17:20 <@Hixie> draq: i mean, unless they are going to get a license for that font and ship it to everyone around the web...
17:21 <@draq> But the same distribution exists for every other font...
17:21 <@draq> s/distribution/distribution problem
17:22 <@draq> Doesn't font-family try to tackle the problem?
17:24 <@Hixie> <Hixie> draq: authors should specify multiple fonts and always give a generic fallback (sans-serif, in this case)
17:28 <@draq> Hixie: ok, thanks for your insight

22:45 <@NoVisAnima> see aero while we're not playing Q3
22:45 <@NoVisAnima> or me while people are playing CS
22:45 <+Rach|here> I'll be playing CS
22:45 <+Rach|here> you should know that :)
22:45 <@NoVisAnima> i do
22:46 <@NoVisAnima> we usually have the system of playing the game that someone has suggested we play
22:49 <@NoVisAnima> simple
22:49 <+Rach|here> sounds good to me
22:50 <+Rach|here> not that I'll be there for this one dammit
22:52 <+Krypt|LTop> lo
22:52 <+Rach|here> lo Krypt|LTop
22:52 <+Bonne_> best dust off those 2x120gb hds that i 'borrowed' from work for the lan too
22:53 <+Bonne_> hey krypt
22:53 <+Krypt|LTop> heh
22:53 <+Krypt|LTop> still got a dvdr "borrowed"?
22:54 <+Bonne_> yep
22:54 <+Krypt|LTop> bastard :)
22:54 <+Bonne_> that's pants tho
22:54 <+Bonne_> i've got a 4x sony one
22:55 <+Dax> got one of those DVD +/- rw jobbies?
22:55 <+Krypt|LTop> had that much money you didn't know what to spend it on ehh?
22:55 <+Bonne_> which is silver, so it looks nice in the shuttle box
22:55 <+Bonne_> Dax: yeah +-
22:55 <+Krypt|LTop> :)
22:55 <+Bonne_> and yes about the money too :)
22:55 <+Bonne_> i'm sponsered now
22:55 <+Krypt|LTop> ohh sweet
22:56 <+Bonne_> 400/month
22:56 <+Krypt|LTop> fuck! that's like enough to cover everything
22:56 <@NoVisAnima> O_O
22:56 <@NoVisAnima> lucky bastard
22:56 <+Bonne_> but the best bit is that's its no conditions - like working for them after
22:56 <+Bonne_> so it's just free money
22:56 <+Krypt|LTop> yeah, I was goin to ask
22:57 <+Krypt|LTop> so they appreciated the work you did for them in your placement that much that they are willing to give an extra £3k
22:57 <+Bonne_> they relied on me so much
22:58 <+Bonne_> i seemed like i was the only one with any computer skills
22:58 <@NoVisAnima> ~:O
22:58 <+Krypt|LTop> heh, so they can still like ring you up and go "richard, how do we add a new administrator again?" :D
22:58 <+Bonne_> they email me
22:59 <+Bonne_> i can vpn in and remote desktop the server
22:59 <+Krypt|LTop> :) so where abouts you living this year?
22:59 -!- mode/#buncs [+o Kamakaze] by Q
22:59 <+Bonne_> i'm now in wellsway
23:00 <+Krypt|LTop> ?
23:00 <+Bonne_> which is up the road from you
23:00 <+Bonne_> and where i used to live
23:00 <+Krypt|LTop> ahh
23:00 <+Bonne_> nice place too
23:01 <+Krypt|LTop> I thought you must have moved seeing as you just said "internet that belongs to me" you'd got new adsl somewhere
23:01 <+Bonne_> you know alex, the one of the guys i lived with?
23:01 <+Bonne_> yeah
23:01 <+Krypt|LTop> i think I remeber alex, rugby player build,
23:01 <+Bonne_> that;s the one
23:02 <+Bonne_> his parents bought this house, and we pay them rent
23:02 <+Bonne_> its all new and shiny
23:02 <+Bonne_> like students haven't lived in it for years on end
23:02  * Krypt|LTop is confused... same house as before?
23:02 <+Bonne_> no
23:02 <+Krypt|LTop> ahh ok
23:03 <+Bonne_> that old house in wells road ended up being full of what i like to call 'randoms'
23:03 <+WarAtWar> Hmm.
23:03 <+Krypt|LTop> heh
23:03 <+Bonne_> - people we didn't know the names of
23:03 <+Krypt|LTop> fair enough
23:03 <+Krypt|LTop> so how was Marie's time in (Harvard)?
23:04 <+Bonne_> excellent
23:04 <+WarAtWar> How many people can you usually fit into a typical student house around bath?
23:04 <+Bonne_> she got a really good report from them
23:04 <+Rach|here> 42.259
23:04 <+Krypt|LTop> WarAtWar :: 5 here :)
23:04 <+Krypt|LTop> Bonne_ nice
23:04 <+Krypt|LTop> did you go out to harvard?
23:04 <+Bonne_> her tutor said the light was glowing out of the envelope
23:04 <+Dax> 3 in my house War :P
23:04 <+Bonne_> WarAtWar: 5 here too
23:04 <+Bonne_> 7 in old place
23:05 <+Krypt|LTop> Bonne_ : heh, that's pretty good!
23:05 <+Dax> 1mbit con for 1.2 users (point 2 cos they bearly use it)
23:05  * WarAtWar scratches his beard
23:05 <+Dax> :)
23:05 <+Krypt|LTop> so where abouts are you on wellsway?
23:05 <+WarAtWar> Are there any which'll hold 8?
23:05 <+Bonne_> Krypt|LTop: yeah boston was really cool
23:05 <+Bonne_> 115
23:05 <+Dax> War: I know someone with 12 ppl 
23:06 <+Dax> You have to look early and keep looking
23:06 <+WarAtWar> Alright.
23:06 <+Bonne_> by the sign that says 7.5 tonne weight limit on entry hill
23:06 <+Krypt|LTop> heh, so you basically moved down the street a bit ?
23:06 <+WarAtWar> We're already planning on looking for somewhere next year.
23:06 <+Bonne_> WarAtWar: there's an 8 person house in wells road
23:06 <+WarAtWar> Dunno how many of us there'll be yet. I'm thinking it'll probably be 8 of us.
23:06 <+Krypt|LTop> yeah, bonnes old house was alright
23:06 <+Bonne_> 105 iirc
23:06 <@NoVisAnima> bit keen
23:06 <+WarAtWar> As I expect the two foreign students will go with their friends rather than us.
23:06 <+Dax> War: if you split into 2 lots of 4 you have lots more choice
23:06 <+WarAtWar> We want first cjoice.
23:07 <+WarAtWar> choice
23:07 <+Bonne_> um
23:07 <@NoVisAnima> *sigh*
23:07  * WarAtWar shrugs
23:07 <+Bonne_> choice on what
23:08 <@NoVisAnima> and this house was found in 3 days
23:08 <@NoVisAnima> when we didn't even have a 3rd person
23:08 <@NoVisAnima> i was *really* out of it during the house finding period
23:08 <+Bonne_> where are you now?
23:08 <+WarAtWar> Broadband is available to all of Bath isn't it?
23:08 <+Bonne_> and you Krypt|LTop
23:08 <+Dax> most of bath
23:08  * WarAtWar really does not want to go back to 56k
23:08 <+Krypt|LTop> same place as before
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> lol
23:09 <+Bonne_> uhuh
23:09 <+Dax> but dsl is available all over
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> 8 way shared 56k
23:09 <+Bonne_> mmm
23:09 <+Dax> loool novis
23:09 <+WarAtWar> Yes :/,
23:09 <+WarAtWar> Three way shared 56k was bad enough.
23:09 <+Dax> oh yeah - that's why you want 2x 4 ppl
23:09 <+Dax> 2mbit goes WAY further with 4 ppl
23:10 <+WarAtWar> I'm the only serious internet user in our group. It's not really a problem.
23:10 <+Dax> well
23:10 <+Dax> still
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> they'll learn the internet
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> they always do
23:10 <+Dax> kazaaa - they find it
23:10 <+Dax> no matter how innocent
23:10 <+WarAtWar> They're all on laptops. I'm the only one with serious expansion options.
23:10 <+Bonne_> ha
23:10 <+Dax> OMG: What have I done!! Wireless is now up and working :(
23:11 <@NoVisAnima> kazaa will happen sooner or later
23:11 <@NoVisAnima> it always does
23:11 <+Dax> my 2 housemates have already started using the net more and more
23:11 <+Krypt|LTop> heh, I have a nice laptop, my desktop is for expanision if I can ever be bothered
23:12 <+Bonne_> what the graphics card like in that
23:12 <+Dax> I want a laptop
23:12 <+Rach|here> sit down
23:12 <+Krypt|LTop> in laptop? radeon 7500
23:12 <+Rach|here> look down
23:12 <+Rach|here> there's your laptop
23:12 <+Rach|here> sorted
23:12  * WarAtWar sits his computer on his lap
23:12 <@NoVisAnima> bah i dont need no laptop
23:13 <@NoVisAnima> i'm *not* gonig to put my computer on my lap
23:13  * WarAtWar gets his legs crushed
23:13 <+Bonne_> can't seem to plug my mouse into knee
23:13 <+Rach|here> laptops are very limited for upgradability
23:13 <+Krypt|LTop> it seemed to handle jedi academy 2 ok :) but only 256 ram cripples its ability to play things like generals smoothly
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> i dont want to put a desktop machine a 19" monitor an amp and a sub onto my lap
23:14 <@NoVisAnima> that would be stupid
23:14  * WarAtWar doesn't want to put all that and more on his :P
23:14 <+Bonne_> anyone read about some prat who burned his knob on a dell laptop?
23:14 <+Rach|here> but you seem to be in a daft mood, do it
23:14 <+Rach|here> lol
23:14 <+Bonne_> because it was on his lap
23:14 <+WarAtWar> Yeah, laptops have a real heat problem these days.
23:14 <+Krypt|LTop> yeah, thighs and his penis
23:15 <+Krypt|LTop> mine gets rather warm, it's more of a desktop replacement jobbie
23:15 <+Evo> wasn't it on a long-haul flight or some such
23:15 <+Krypt|LTop> bit like the guy that got frost bite in his toes from the aircon in his Jag
23:15 <+WarAtWar> I'm guessing the only way you'd miss the slowly increasing burning pain would be to fall asleep.
23:16 <+Dax> desktops rule.... but it nice to have a lappy about
23:16 <+Dax> 3+ hour flights deserve one for sure!
23:16 <+WarAtWar> I suppose.
23:17 <+Krypt|LTop> yep, which reminds me that I need to look for a latex render for windows
23:17 <@NoVisAnima> pah you dont need that
23:17 <+Dax> latex, eh :P
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> you can compile the latex files into pdf...
23:18 <+Dax> I suggest the use of natural lotions... :P
23:18 <+Krypt|LTop> uhh, yeah, cos windows comes with a latex converter built in....
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> do all that at uni
23:18 <+Krypt|LTop> ohh, nah
23:18 <@NoVisAnima> remotely if nessessary
23:18 <+Krypt|LTop> need it for my laptop
23:19 <+Krypt|LTop> pfft
23:19 <+Krypt|LTop> don't have internet on trains or at home
23:20  * NoVisAnima wonders if Krypt|LTop has bothered googling yet
23:20 <+Krypt|LTop> lookin at MiKTeX
23:21 <@NoVisAnima> yup, spotted that one
23:27 <+WarAtWar> How the hell does Outlook figure I have 4 new mail. Whatever amount of new mail I get, it always says 4.
23:27 <+Krypt|LTop> lol
23:28 <+Dax> War go chuck outloook and get a decent mail client :)
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> but outlook is the only one that can log into my hotmail / spam account
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> i need that spam damnit
23:29 <+Dax> pffft
23:29 <+Dax> you have a spam filter
23:29 <+Dax> just check it once a week
23:29 <+Dax> :O
23:29 <@NoVisAnima> but my hotmail account ends up being used for random stuff where i dont care who has the addy
23:30 <+Dax> then get a domain and tell everyone to email to it
23:30 <+Dax> :P
23:31 <+Bonne_> you could use hotpops or whatever its called to connect via pop3 to hotmail
23:31 <+Dax> You can get apps that allow use of hotmail webmail thru other clients
23:31 <+Bonne_> then you can use outlook express :)
23:31 <+Krypt|LTop> you can use outlook express with hotmail without using that
23:32 <+Bonne_> oh
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> exactly
23:32 <+Bonne_> pfft
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> which is what i do ATM
23:32 <+Rach|here> automatic transaction machine?
23:32 <+Dax> t = teller
23:32 <@NoVisAnima> at the moment
23:32 <+Rach|here> I know, I know
23:32 <+Rach|here> t=teller in US
23:32 <+Dax> but I agree
23:32 <+Rach|here> who says teller over here?
23:32 <+Dax> it SHUD be transaction
23:33 <+Rach|here> no one, that's who
23:33 <+Krypt|LTop> tller over here afaik...
23:33 <+Dax> if we invent an acronym then we can say what is stands for :)
23:33 <+Krypt|LTop> as in Bank Tellar
23:33 <+Krypt|LTop> Teller even
23:33 <+Dax> Damn how we failed on ANSI/ASCII
23:33 <+Rach|here> except the US tourists
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> eh?
23:33 <@NoVisAnima> no we dont Krypt|LTop
23:33 <+Rach|here> what don't we do?
23:34 <+Krypt|LTop> pfft, people in banks do
23:34 <+Rach|here> oh, use teller, no, we don't
23:34 <+Dax> look
23:34 <+Krypt|LTop> atm = automated teller machine
23:34 <+Dax> whetehr you like it or not, it's TELLER (thanks krypt :D)
23:34 <+Bonne_> i thought it was async transfer mode
23:34 <+Dax> heh
23:34 <+Dax> :D
23:34 <+Dax> thank god for etherenet
23:35 <+WarAtWar> So tired.

19:07 <@NoVisAnima> woo
19:08 <+Dax|About> apparently you don't do member cards...
19:09 <@NoVisAnima> no we dont
19:09 <@NoVisAnima> we run by an idiot system
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> we ask people if they are members
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> and idiots will tell us no
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> so we make them pay then
19:10 <+Dax|About> lol
19:10 <+Dax|About> you could just print off a list of usernames
19:11 <@NoVisAnima> heeh
19:13 <@NoVisAnima> well yeah we could
19:16 <@NoVisAnima> but that sounds too organised for my liking
19:16 <+Dax|About> okay - ppl walk in and either sign name off list OR pay :P
19:16 <+Dax|About> easy as pie
19:16 <+Dax|About> mmmm pie
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> pfft
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> i'll just randomly poke people who's faces i dont recognise
19:19 <@NoVisAnima> given enough poking they'll either pay or protest that they've already paid and want to know why the long haired fool is repeatedly poking them

00:03 <@Krypt0n> the first rule of project mayhem is we don't talk about projet mayhem
00:04  * WarAtWar is doing well
00:04 < WarAtWar> I've never talked about project mayhem.
00:06 <+Dax|About> you have now :P
00:07 < WarAtWar> Dang.

00:12 <@Krypt0n> ahh
00:12 <@Kamakaze> i could blog about you that would get at least 1 hit a year

00:15 <+Dax|Crying> where were u when u saw me?
00:15 <+Dax|Crying> oh shit - how rude was I... I just remember!
00:15 <@Krypt0n> walking towards teh bust stop
00:15 <+Dax|Crying> sorry

00:16 <@Krypt0n> yeah
00:16 <+Dax|Crying> yeah - I preferred the long hair
00:16 <+Dax|Crying> but I need a job
00:17  * WarAtWar wonders which would take more effort. Getting a few big sites to link him, or lots of little ones.
00:18 <+Dax|Crying> it's always effort
00:18 <+Dax|Crying> ppl want to know why you're linking them,
00:18 <+Dax|Crying> best bet is to find some chums with bigger sites :)
00:18 <@Kamakaze> post a link to it on shacknews comments
00:18 <+Dax|Crying> looool
00:18 <+Dax|Crying> get it /.
00:18 <@Krypt0n> dax, goin for a placement?
00:19 <+Dax|Crying> not planning on it

00:20 <@Krypt0n> or just a job term time?
00:21 <+Dax|Crying> nah a job now
00:21 <+Dax|Crying> yeah
00:21 <+Dax|Crying> WAR: Your webby still has a faulty image...
00:21 <@Kamakaze> get a job as a circus freak
00:21 < WarAtWar> What?

00:22 <@Krypt0n> 410's
00:22 <+Dax|Crying> yeah
00:22 < WarAtWar> Yes.
00:22 < WarAtWar> no remote linking to comics.
00:22 <+Dax|Crying> erm
00:22 <+Dax|Crying> well I can't see the homepage at all
00:22 <+Dax|Crying> ignore that last line
00:23 <+Dax|Crying> I mean I can't see the image on the homepage
00:23 <+Dax|Crying> that's the url
00:23  * Krypt0n is starting to feel better \o/
00:23  * Dax|Crying fluffles Krypt0n
00:24 <@Krypt0n> it's like I suddenly have loads of energy
00:24 < WarAtWar> You don't have zonealarm running do you?
00:24 < WarAtWar> Or a Norton firewall?
00:24 <@Krypt0n> although that's partly to do with Slipknot
00:24 <@Krypt0n> what's the refering page?
00:25 <+Dax|Crying> War: no, but I am running a hardware firewall
00:26 < WarAtWar> Never heard of that affecting it :/.
00:27  * WarAtWar shrugs
00:27 <+Dax|Crying> why does ZA or Norton stop it?
00:27 < WarAtWar> They just had issues with keenspace. Dunno what it was.
00:28 <+Dax|Crying> sounds like Keenspace does silly things :(
00:28 < WarAtWar> keenspace has a lot of problems.
00:29 < WarAtWar> The whole keen franchise doesn't really work too well as a business. It's mostly the people running it.
00:29 <+Dax|Crying> ah
00:29 <+Dax|Crying> sounds like you need your own hosting :P
00:30 <+Dax|Crying> </pimp
00:30 <+Dax|Crying> ?
00:30 < WarAtWar> :P
00:30 <@Krypt0n> tbh with that much bandwidth to throw around they should be hosting pr0n not comics :D
00:30  * WarAtWar estimates bandwidth used per day by keenspace
00:31 <+ChocoJon> We have Halfy in this house for that
00:31 <+Dax|Crying> too right!
00:31 <@Krypt0n> lol
00:31 <+Dax|Crying> I have a mate with unlimited co-loc space and unlimited bandwidth
00:31 <+Dax|Crying> I'm about to post him a 250 gigger for my use :P
00:31 <+ChocoJon> Unlimited?
00:31 <+Dax|Crying> UNLIMITED
00:31 <+ChocoJon> oooooh
00:32 <@Krypt0n> how much is that costing?
00:32 <+Dax|Crying> he doesn't pay
00:32 <+ChocoJon> how does he manage it then?
00:32 <@Kamakaze> i dont believe you that its unlimited
00:32 <+ChocoJon> lo Kamakaze
00:32 <+Dax|Crying> it's provided by the host for free
00:32 <@Krypt0n> I used to know a guy in the us that had "unlimited" 100mbit colo, paid elcheapo, but unlimited was limited
00:32 <+ChocoJon> 100mbit != unlimited
00:33 <+ChocoJon> also, you can *never* have too much HD space
00:33 <+Dax|Crying> he works for a computer mag... so the host doesn't limit anything
00:33 -!- Kaya [~kaya@du-040-0106.access.clara.net] has quit [Ping timeout]
00:33 <@Krypt0n> unlimited was "about 600GB/year"
00:34 <@Kamakaze> i think if you used unlimited space and bandwidth there might be complaints
00:34 <+Dax|Crying> basically he runs a massive ftp server off it
00:34 <+Dax|Crying> and has had no issues at all
00:35 < WarAtWar> Hmm, based on my stats, and my stats in comparison to others. I think keenspace shifts about a 80 to 100gig a day.
00:35 <@Krypt0n> what sort of ftp?
00:35 <@Krypt0n> WarAtWar :: that's plenty for a reasonable pr0n site
00:36 <+ChocoJon> nah 1TB a day would be good for a pr0n site

00:37 < WarAtWar> I'd guess that keenspot gets through more in a day. less now because Real Life left them I guess.
00:37 <+ChocoJon> w/ocontext, do they like their fantasy world?
00:37 < WarAtWar> ?
00:38 <+ChocoJon> "beacause Real Life has left them"
00:39 < WarAtWar> :P

00:46 < Krypt|LTop> mhh, kde loading, nice
00:47 < Krypt|LTop> uhh, safety crit? I forgot about that... eeep
00:47 < Krypt|LTop> no, I wasn't at safety crit. was it boring?
00:48 <@Kamakaze> dear god safety critical systems was a boring lecture
00:49 <@Kamakaze> luckily the few i went to it was in a big room and i sat at the back playing on my gba
00:49 < Krypt|LTop> knoppix kicks arse, mounted my fat drives, playing my mp3s with xmms
00:49 <@NoVisAnima> http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma1pm/SafetyCrit.html
00:50 < Krypt|LTop> you wrote them up?!!!!
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> yes
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> because you weren't there
00:50 < Krypt|LTop> wow
00:50 < Krypt|LTop> cheers!!!!
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> you know i'm friendly
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> damnit
00:50 <@Kamakaze> we got the slides ina nice binder for that course when we did it
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> so did we
00:50 < Krypt|LTop> woot for NoVisAnima
00:51 <@NoVisAnima> but you have to write in them
00:51 < Krypt|LTop> yeah, like otherwise they are useless
00:51 <@Kamakaze> not for that subject really
00:51 <@Kamakaze> its a load of waffle
00:52 <@draq> damn why do floats float across the whole page, instead of say, just a div !
00:52 <@Kamakaze> because they suck
00:53 < Krypt|LTop> because they are floats, and they float on the whole page, unless you contain them
00:54 < Krypt|LTop> can only really contain them to do thinks like thumbnail things though
00:55 <@draq> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/pictures/blog/hyy/vtlove.jpg
00:55 < Krypt|LTop> silly question, how do I restart X?
00:55 <@draq> ctrl+alt+backspace
00:55 <@draq> how do you contain them ?
00:57 < Krypt|LTop> if you put <div style="clear: both;"> above and below them that means they actually take up page space. beyond that that's about it :/
00:57 < Krypt|LTop> btw that restarted the machine, not just X
00:59 <@draq> Krypt|LTop: the machine? yeah right!

22:21 < WarAtWar> Well this weekend was an experience on the internet.
22:21 < WarAtWar> Or not on the internet as it turned out.
22:22 < al`> u guys at bath uni?
22:22 <+Dax|Chillin> yup
22:22 <+Dax|Chillin> War - what?
22:23 < WarAtWar> They screwed something up on Saturday. Fiddled around with the firewall and nobody could use anything on the net. Except IE.
22:23 < al`> and msn
22:23 <+Dax|Chillin> ah
22:23 < al`> irc, cs and everything were blocked
22:23 <+Dax|Chillin> did you tyr irc on other ports or routing thru proxy?
22:23 < al`> tried quite a few other ports
22:23 < al`> didnt work
22:24  * WarAtWar nods
22:24 < al`> didnt try routing thru proxy :)
22:24 <+Dax|Chillin> did ya email the resnet ppl?
22:25 < WarAtWar> Look at the forum.
22:25 < WarAtWar> Most activity it's ever seen.
22:26 < al`> url?
22:26  * WarAtWar mentally inserts kazaa into everyones list of stuff that doesn't work
22:27 < WarAtWar> http://internal.bath.ac.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=11&sid=e0290b1fc6296dcb77ed02f7b0adc8ef
22:27 <+Dax|Chillin> al - internal.bath.ac.uk/forums
22:27 < al`> kk
22:27 <+Dax|Chillin> Neil Francis: It is possible that this was an unfortunate side effect of a recent configuration change on the firewall.
22:27 < WarAtWar> He also said that they changed it back.
22:28 < WarAtWar> And it seems most people started having problems after that.
22:28 -!- Kamakaze [Kam@213.78.104.193] has quit [Signed off]
22:29 < WarAtWar> But all seems well now.
22:30 <+Dax|Chillin> all those stupid ppl can't use forums
22:30 <+Dax|Chillin> firstly ALL of their problems are the same, so why so many threads
22:30 <+Dax|Chillin> and so many replies
22:30 <+Dax|Chillin> and also - they should read the other posts before repeating them!
22:30 < al`> there any bath uni cs servers?
22:31 <+Dax|Chillin> al - not run by BUCS
22:31 <+Dax|Chillin> some ppl run their own private ones
22:31 < al`> k
22:31 <+Dax|Chillin> and who knows - buncs may try to do so if we can
22:31 < al`> :)
22:31 < al`> was just wondering how many cs players there are walking around here
22:32 <+Dax|Chillin> loads of cs players on resnet
22:32  * WarAtWar really should buy Half life
22:32 < al`> :)
22:32 <+Dax|Chillin> War - u can get it for like a tenner now, OR find someone who doesn't play anymore
22:32 < WarAtWar> £4 apparently.
22:32 <+Dax|Chillin> lol
22:32 < al`> ye its well cheap now
22:33 < WarAtWar> I just never actually think about it when I'm in town.
22:33 <+Dax|Chillin> order it :p
22:33  * WarAtWar is getting annoyed at scan now.
22:34 < WarAtWar> This is the 3rd time my order has been delayed.
22:34 < WarAtWar> Bet they lost my order again.
22:34 <+Dax|Chillin> then don't order from them :P
22:35 <+Dax|Chillin> Try dabs, simply, ebuyer or IS
22:35 < al`> u got any ip's for cs servers with bath uni ppl on?
22:35 <+Dax|Chillin> al - no idea
22:35 < al`> k
22:35 < WarAtWar> Dabs is a pain, can't use them right now.
22:35 < al`> sorry for all the questions
22:35 < al`> :)
22:35 <+Dax|Chillin> al: like lookin for a needle in haystack :P
22:35 < al`> ye
22:35 <+Dax|Chillin> that's np :P
22:36 <+Dax|Chillin> War: y?#
22:36 < WarAtWar> Your first order with Dabs has to be mailed to the credit card owners address. Which is still my home address because you can't do f'all online with HSBC.
22:37 <+Dax|Chillin> isn't there a hsbc on campus?
22:37 < WarAtWar> With their fancy schmancy automatic address finder which doesn't work.
22:37 < WarAtWar> Open Tuesday and Thursdays for about 5 minutes it seems.
22:37 <+Dax|Chillin> well a lot of online stores require a credit card registered to same address
22:37 < WarAtWar> I'll have to go down to town and change my address at some point.

20:21 <+endeavour> which changes "Wetherspoons" into "Waterspouts"
20:24 <+endeavour> Wetherspoons opening in Bath in July 2004
20:24 <+endeavour> :D
20:24 <@Neil|Work> :/
20:24 <@Neil|Work> re the spellcheck I mean
20:24 <@Neil|Work> re Wetherspoons, I live in Guildford now and we have one of those anyway :)
20:25 <+endeavour> They have them everywhere except Bath it would seem
20:25 <+endeavour> I was shocked there isn't one
20:25 <+endeavour> nowhere to get cheap pub food after 6pm :(

14:25  * Krypt|LTop had an odd dream thing this morning
14:32 <@NoVisAnima> oooh?
14:33 <+Krypt|LTop> yeah, it involved walking along the high street in newbury, seeing a software development place where a shop should be
14:34 <+Krypt|LTop> this shop had a couple of creative hard drive mp3 player things outside, so I nicked one, but I ended up feeling guilty, and took it back.
14:35 <+Krypt|LTop> when I took it back Flo was in there working on some code, and he was "checking compatability of his port of the control software to suse" and he happily waved a couple of the things around
14:37 <@NoVisAnima> urm
14:37 <@NoVisAnima> you dreamt of flo...
14:37 <@NoVisAnima> aagggggghhhhh
14:37 <+Krypt|LTop> yes indeed, scary
14:40 <@NoVisAnima> i know i had an odd dream, which is why i started playing games to make myself forget
14:42 <@NoVisAnima> i was successful

18:06 <+endeavour> Any idea if STA Travel on campus sells train tickets?
18:06 <+endeavour> and if so, what time is it open until on Saturday
18:06 <@Novis|hoover> they do sell train tickets
18:07 -!- Novis|hoover is now known as NoVisAnima
18:07 <@NoVisAnima> but i dont know when / if they are open on saturday
18:07 <+endeavour> looks like just mon/fri from their website
18:08 <@NoVisAnima> probably the case then
18:11 <+endeavour> would order from thetrainline.com
18:11 <+endeavour> but it's too complicated to find out if he tickets are flexible or you have to use them at a specified time
18:15 <@NoVisAnima> i cant remember if they are or not
18:15 <@NoVisAnima> i believe they might be but i'm not so sure
18:26 <+endeavour> mm
18:26 <+endeavour> where is the train station in town?
18:26 <+endeavour> by the bus station?
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> yeah
18:28 <@NoVisAnima> v.close
18:32 <+endeavour> ok
18:51 <+endeavour> right
18:51 <+endeavour> sorted
18:51 <+endeavour> £27.05 return (with railcard)
18:51 <+endeavour> this country
18:54 <+Krypt|LTop> where you goin?
18:58 <+endeavour> home
18:58 <+endeavour> next weekend
18:58 <+endeavour> (cambridge)
19:00 <+endeavour> put it on ticket-collection from bath spa station though
19:00 <+endeavour> not sure I trust royal mail at the minute
19:00 <+Krypt|LTop> :)
19:00 <+Krypt|LTop> super saver return?
19:02 <+endeavour> SuperAdvance Return
19:02 <+endeavour> or something
19:02 <+endeavour> SuperSaver is only for evening travel i think
19:03 <+endeavour> Got to get a bus for 15 minutes on the return journey for some reason
19:03 <+endeavour> wierd sunday timetables
19:04 <+Krypt|LTop> yeh, or some sort of track maintainance
19:05 <+endeavour> or that
19:37 <+endeavour> anyone going to the fireworks?
19:39 <+Krypt|LTop> goin to pub :.

19:42 <@NoVisAnima> heh
19:42 <@NoVisAnima> i could have just stayed here and watched the proceedings from my balcony
19:43 <@NoVisAnima> it was rather good last year
19:43 <@NoVisAnima> you could see every amature display in bath going off at the same time
19:43 <+endeavour> amateur
19:43 <+Krypt|LTop> i've never been
19:44 <+endeavour> fireworks bring back joyful memories
19:44 <@NoVisAnima> yeah, we used to go to the local park for fireworks every year
19:44 <+endeavour> about 20 of us from sixth form went last year, and they had the fireworks timed to music (on crap speakers)
19:45 <@NoVisAnima> they've probably gone there now
19:45 <+endeavour> watching all the girls drunkenly dancing to S Club 7 - Reach was hilarious
19:45 <+endeavour> it might be Steps
19:45 <+endeavour> dunno
19:45 <+endeavour> one of those cheesy bands
19:45 <@NoVisAnima> s club 7
19:45 <+endeavour> ok
19:45 <@NoVisAnima> i know *blush*
19:45 <+endeavour> :P
19:45 <+endeavour> cheese is good
19:45 -!- mode/#buncs [+v Bonne] by NoVisAnima
19:45 <+endeavour> just as well, listening to Hot Chocolate at the moment
19:46 <@NoVisAnima> i'm just listening to the kill bill soundtrack in a random order
19:47 <@NoVisAnima> and have been defeated by local fish and chip shop chips again
19:48 <+endeavour> oooh
19:48 <+endeavour> could fancy fish & chips
19:48 <+endeavour> where is a good place to go
19:48 <@NoVisAnima> well my local is pretty good
19:48 <@NoVisAnima> but i doubt you want a 2 hour round trip
19:49 <+endeavour> lol
19:49 <+endeavour> not really
19:49 <+endeavour> i meant in bath
19:49 <@NoVisAnima> urm
19:49 <@NoVisAnima> i am in bath
19:49 <@NoVisAnima> it takes 1 hour to get from uni to here
19:49 <+endeavour> on stilts
19:49 <@NoVisAnima> doesn't matter if you walk or take the bus
19:50 <@NoVisAnima> and it'll take another hour to get back
19:50 <@NoVisAnima> trust me i live here
19:50 <@NoVisAnima> i can see the uni from here
19:50 <@NoVisAnima> bath is shaped like a big... hole
19:50 <@NoVisAnima> you are on one side and i am on the other
19:51 <+Krypt|LTop> hah, what if he rode a bike, would only take 40mins round trip
19:51 <+endeavour> they should put a giant trampoline at the bottom of the hill
19:51 <+endeavour> then you could bounce from one side of bath to the other
19:52 <+endeavour> neglecting air resistance and the momentum you could gain by jumping being insufficient of course
19:52 <@NoVisAnima> not a fricken chance Krypt|LTop
19:52 <+endeavour> could work on the moon possibly
19:52 <@NoVisAnima> surely
19:52 <+Krypt|LTop> pfft, bike is about three times faster than walking, on average
19:52 <+Krypt|LTop> for me anyway
19:52 <@NoVisAnima> right
19:53 <@NoVisAnima> so 15 mins into town
19:53 <+endeavour> Bikes and trampolines don't mix
19:53 <+Krypt|LTop> hmm, 10, fly down widcombe on bike
19:53 <@NoVisAnima> they do if the trampoline is big enough
19:53 <@NoVisAnima> right then, you've then got to get to my house
19:53 <@NoVisAnima> that's up hill ish for 15
19:54 <@NoVisAnima> down in 12
19:54 <+Krypt|LTop> mhh, i don't really know how long it takes to walk to yours
19:54 <@NoVisAnima> i get back from richard's on foot in about 12 / 15 mins depend on how happy i am
19:55 <+Krypt|LTop> ohh right, not all that far then
19:55 <@NoVisAnima> my walking speed...
19:55 <@NoVisAnima> but yeah not *that* far
19:56 <@NoVisAnima> i still need that sort of lead time to know when to leave for things
19:56 <+endeavour> right
19:56 <+endeavour> time for a cuppa and a trip to the cashpoint
19:56 <+endeavour> then fireworks
19:56 <@NoVisAnima> so you can do it in an hour by bike
19:57 <@NoVisAnima> maybe
19:57 <+Krypt|LTop> yeah, probably about right
19:57 <@NoVisAnima> i need to get a more acurate time
19:57 <@NoVisAnima> i know i can get to uni on the hour if i leave here on the previous
19:58 <@NoVisAnima> but that's got waiting around for the bus time in there
19:58 <@NoVisAnima> and it took an hour pure walking

18:12 < Kitty_N> i got out of seeing eammonn
18:12 < Kitty_N> 'cs he was going home
18:12 <@NoVisAnima> 'got out of it'
18:12 <@NoVisAnima> surely it should be a good thing to see him
18:13 < Kitty_N> haha
18:13 <@NoVisAnima> ~:|
18:16  * Kitty_N is doing agents
18:16 < Kitty_N> you know what
18:16 < Kitty_N> there's this girl on our course who looks like she has had collagen injections in her lips
18:16 < Kitty_N> and she walks around with her mouth open slightly
18:16 < Kitty_N> and she looks like a fish
18:16 < Kitty_N> and she is blonde
18:16 < Kitty_N> and she must be ULTRA DUMB
18:16 <@NoVisAnima> i think i know who you are refering to
18:16 < Kitty_N> i was laughing at her in management
18:17 < Kitty_N> she's tristans partner for agents
18:17 <@NoVisAnima> i thought so
18:17 < Kitty_N> dear oh dear
18:17 < Kitty_N> she had this handout thing and one of the pages had flipepd over the wrong way
18:17 < Kitty_N> and she was trying to flip it back one handed 
18:17 < Kitty_N> and just generally being BLONDE
18:17 < Kitty_N> grrrr
18:17 < Kitty_N> stupid collagen girl
18:17 <@NoVisAnima> ~:D
18:17 <@NoVisAnima> so how's your agents partner
18:17 < Kitty_N> haha
18:18 < Kitty_N> elusive
18:18 < Kitty_N> which is why i am dogin agents now
18:18 < Kitty_N> jolly jolly d
18:18 <@NoVisAnima> i should have read something
18:18 <@NoVisAnima> and done something
18:19 <@NoVisAnima> but really i think i'm just going to stop bothering, i'm too tired
18:20 <@NoVisAnima> even though tom's old flat mate randomly noticed me and told me not to O_o
18:20 < Kitty_N> who?
18:20 < Kitty_N> ohh
18:20 < Kitty_N> that tom
18:21 <@NoVisAnima> *nods*
18:23 < Kitty_N> agents is actually well confusing
18:23 <@NoVisAnima> how so?
18:24 <@NoVisAnima> i mean i know i have no fsking idea what so ever what i'm supposed to be doing ... but other than that...
18:27 < Kitty_N> wel

18:29 <@NoVisAnima> To me it seemed quite obvious what i was supposed to end up with and how to interface with the system
18:29 < Kitty_N> more helpful
18:29 <@NoVisAnima> helpful, but it makes things harder
18:29 <@NoVisAnima> i read through that 2 weeks back
18:32 <@NoVisAnima> makes thing easier to understand
18:32 < Kitty_N> :/
18:32 <@NoVisAnima> what?
18:32 < Kitty_N> so basically the 3 auctions are different types of auction
18:32 < Kitty_N> therefore you need a different strategy for each
18:34 <@NoVisAnima> exactly
18:35 < Kitty_N> it's all very confusing
18:35 <@NoVisAnima> yup, that's what i discovered 2 weeks ago

16:27 <+Dax|Chillin> hmm
16:28 <@Krypt0n> as going to get the CP5-8JD1F-0L from ebuyer as it's got good reviews and is pretty damn cheap, and anythings got to be quieter than my current cpu fan

16:37 <+Dax|Chillin> if you want to work out how noisy your psu is, just put a pen it in and stop it for 30 secs
16:38 <@Krypt0n> lol
16:38 <+Dax|Chillin> seriously! :P
16:38 <+Dax|Chillin> easiest way to compare fan noise... do it one by one :)

16:41 <@Krypt0n> yeah, I think the fan may have been a little damaged by that, but whatever :)
16:41 <@Krypt0n> cpu fan, followed by rear fan is the worst. stopping all three just leaves the grphx card
16:44 <@Krypt0n> happy now just to just replace the noisiest two, see how bad it is. with the laptop I really notice the noise now. it's far far too loud
16:44 <+Dax|Chillin> system fans are easy to sort out... make sure whatever you get is <25db... pref 20db
16:44 <@Krypt0n> hmm
16:44 <@Krypt0n> that gets expensive
16:44 <+Dax|Chillin> nah
16:44 <+Dax|Chillin> you gotta look around
16:45 <+Dax|Chillin> cpu ones are harder... you just have to accept a slightly noisier one... but even then you want the lower end of noise :)
16:45 <+WarAtWar> Or spend more and get a Zalman.
16:45 <+WarAtWar> Damn.

16:56 <@NeilOfDoom> which gfx do you have?

17:06 <+Dax|Chillin> It's down to the promise and highpoint dual channel with bios boards..  both are £25
17:07 <@NeilOfDoom> promise are quite a well known brand
17:07 <@NeilOfDoom> google for reviews maybe? :)
17:07 <@NeilOfDoom> know anything about laptop displays?
17:08 <@NeilOfDoom> I remember LCD screens used to suck and TFTs were awesome
17:08 <@NeilOfDoom> but this AlienWare has an LCD :/
17:08 <@NeilOfDoom> Area-51m Chassis with 16.1" UltraXGA 1600x1200 LCD Display - Conspiracy Blue
17:08 <@Krypt0n> hmm
17:08 <+Dax|Chillin> TFT is a type of LCD isn't it...
17:08 <@Krypt0n> well it's 1600x1200 so good
17:08 <+Dax|Chillin> when they sucked, it was a type of LCD called DSN or something
17:08 <+Dax|Chillin> SOmething like TFT > DSN > Black/White
17:09 <+Dax|Chillin> I could be wrong... but I'm sure they're all the same these days
17:09 <@NeilOfDoom> ah that could be it then
17:09 <@NeilOfDoom> TFT = thin-film transistor
17:09 <@NeilOfDoom> I vaugely remember how they work
17:11 <+Dax|Chillin> snap
17:11 <+Dax|Chillin> Fridge coolant systems: Are they like buses or circuits?
17:12 <@Krypt0n> no idea what I am currently using, fairly sure it's a tft
17:12 <+Dax|Chillin> Krypt - TFT is synimous (sp?) with flatscreen these days...
17:13 <@Krypt0n> yep
17:13  * NoVisAnima is pretty sure he's using CRT ~:P
17:13 <+Dax|Chillin> lol
17:14 <+Dax|Chillin> Anyone... I need to know if my fridge is falty or that I was just wrong...
17:15 <@Krypt0n> grr arg. no one seems to have taken my type of laptop apart and posted pictures
17:15 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Chillin what's the problem with it?
17:15  * NoVisAnima hands Krypt0n a screw driver
17:15 <+Dax|Chillin> Fridge coolant systems: Are they like buses or circuits?
17:16 <@Krypt0n> mean's nothing to me...
17:16 <@NoVisAnima> trains?
17:16 <+Dax|Chillin> and you do compsci!
17:16 <@NoVisAnima> yeah that's high level
17:16 <@NeilOfDoom> I don't remember the compsci course covering cooling systems :)
17:16 <+Dax|Chillin> lool
17:16 <@NoVisAnima> not low level electronics
17:16 <+Dax|Chillin> should it run as a loop
17:16 <+Dax|Chillin> or as a sinle tube
17:17 <@Krypt0n> ?
17:17 <@NeilOfDoom> it's a loop
17:17 <+Dax|Chillin> *single
17:17 <+Dax|Chillin> loop
17:17 <@NoVisAnima> it should keep the food cold
17:17 <+Dax|Chillin> right... so my fridge is fucked then
17:17 <@Krypt0n> why is you fridge fucked?
17:17 <@NeilOfDoom> cold coolant comes in, sucks the heat in from the huge metal plate on the back of the fridge
17:17 <@NeilOfDoom> then goes back out again and distributes the heat into the air
17:17 <@Krypt0n> wtf is Neil talking about...
17:17 <@NeilOfDoom> it's just running in a huge circle
17:17 <@Krypt0n> sucks heat in?

17:18 -!- mode/#buncs [+v Bonne-] by NoVisAnima
17:18 <@NeilOfDoom> yes, it absorbs heat from the inside of the fridge
17:18 <@NeilOfDoom> the coolant does
17:18 <@NoVisAnima> you cant suck cold
17:18 <@NeilOfDoom> well duh :)
17:18 <@NeilOfDoom> I was being high level
17:18 <@Krypt0n> just wondering what you meant the huge metal plate on the back of the fridge...
17:19 <@NeilOfDoom> there are two plates at the back
17:19 <@NoVisAnima> (why was i going to say "actually you can if you've had ice cream")
17:19 <@NeilOfDoom> the one on the inside which is in contact with the interior wall
17:19 <@NeilOfDoom> and one on the outside which has lots of fins
17:19 -!- mode/#buncs [+v Kaya] by NoVisAnima
17:19 <@Krypt0n> hmm, I guess that depends on your fridge then
17:19 <@NeilOfDoom> well yeah, but this is the common design
17:20 <@NeilOfDoom> the coolant basically cycles between the two plates by snaking back and fore
17:20 <@Krypt0n> yes
17:20 <+Dax|Chillin> On my on the radiator on outside (lots of fins) has one tube to the compressor and one end that appears to be folded or somthing
17:20 <@NoVisAnima> your radiator?
17:21 <+Dax|Chillin> yes... it's a radiator
17:21 <@NoVisAnima> we're talking about fridges i thought
17:21 <@NeilOfDoom> it's a heatsink, not a radiator :)
17:21 <+Dax|Chillin> it 'radiates' fridges
17:21 <+Dax|Chillin> *heaty
17:21 <@Krypt0n> well heatsink, radiator, same thing
17:21 <+Dax|Chillin> yup
17:21 <@NeilOfDoom> Dax|Chillin :: sure it's a compressor and not a pump?
17:22 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Chillin :: how do you mean folded on something?
17:22 <@NeilOfDoom> it should be a pump that basically cycles the coolant
17:22 <@Krypt0n> well, the pump acts as a compressor
17:23  * NeilOfDoom decides not to have a terminology argument
17:24 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
17:24 <@NoVisAnima> a wise choice
17:26 <@Krypt0n> there should be a loop that runs around the back of the heatsink, both ends should be connected. if they aren't then your fridge won't work
17:26 -!- Dax|Chillin is now known as Dax|Radiator
17:26 <+Dax|Radiator> :P
17:27 <+Dax|Radiator> okay >> http://hub.dax.me.uk/stuff/buncs/my_fridge.jpg
17:28 <+Dax|Radiator> btw - done in paint (as I have yet to install PSP)
17:28 <+Dax|Radiator> NB IS DIRE
17:28 <@Krypt0n> folded as in they fold to go into the fridge
17:29 <@NeilOfDoom> I'm getting an alienware, decided now
17:29 <+Dax|Radiator> lol neil
17:29 <@NeilOfDoom> user-upgradable graphics, end of story
17:29 <+Dax|Radiator> folded as in it's bare and open outside
17:29 <+Dax|Radiator> but appear it could be pressed/folded so as not to let contents out... but just a guess
17:29 <@NeilOfDoom> I might save £500 by getting something else, but I'll only get pissed off in a year when the gfx becomes obsolete
17:30 <@Krypt0n> only one tube going into the fridge?
17:30 <@NeilOfDoom> and there won't be any 64bit laptops for a while
17:30 <@NeilOfDoom> anyway bbs :)
17:30  * NoVisAnima notes that he doesn't recal anyone in #buncs being an expert of fridges / fixing fridges and wonders why Dax|Radiator is asking in here

17:33 <@NoVisAnima> either way, i'm not sure how we can help
17:33 <@Krypt0n> the colours on their diagram suck, but whatever
17:34 <@Krypt0n> the pump is only a compressor due to the fact that there is the expansion valve there
17:54  * Krypt0n wonders what Dax|Radiator's verdict is
17:58 <+Dax|Radiator> well
17:58 <+Dax|Radiator> the fridge appears to work
17:58 <+Dax|Radiator> and I can't see any refrigerant leaking out
17:58 <+Dax|Radiator> so I guess it works fine!
17:59 <+Dax|Radiator> iirc the modern ones are based on ammonia not freon
17:59 <+Dax|Radiator> freon... do I mean that or cfcs

18:15 <@Krypt0n> as in spare cpu?

18:18 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: makes no sense, athlon 1.5 in main pc, 2200+ going spare
18:18 <+Dax|Radiator> Krypton... incompatible
18:19 <+Dax|Radiator> main pc has older mobo

18:20 <@Krypt0n> too amny drives?

18:25 <+aeronic> if youre upgrading
18:25 <@Krypt0n> so I see little point. just going to make it quiet, add a bigger hdd about xmas time and have it running as fileserve/ games machine

18:32 <@NoVisAnima> if you want cheap
18:32 <@NoVisAnima> get a really long network cable

18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> 60Gb 7200rpm hdd
18:39 <+aeronic> but i only need low bandwidth
18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> or 80Gb 4200rpm
18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> 80Gb is £8 more
18:39 <+aeronic> for what
18:39 <+Dax|Radiator> 80 gig
18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> for a laptop
18:39 <+aeronic> 4200rpm ?
18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> yes
18:39 <@NeilOfDoom> slow :/
18:39 <+aeronic> 80gig slower drive

18:40 <+aeronic> what make

18:41 <+aeronic> right
18:41 <+Dax|Radiator> 11mbps
18:41 <+aeronic> whats a g cost
18:41 <+aeronic> 15quid for a bluetooth

18:41 <+aeronic> usb
18:41 <+aeronic> neil, that is insaine
18:41 <+aeronic> insane
18:41 <+aeronic> get a cheaper lappy
18:41 <+aeronic> centrino :)
18:41 <+aeronic> or an athlon64 :)
18:42 <+Dax|Radiator> Cheapest G card I found was £30
18:42 <@NeilOfDoom> why?
18:42 <+aeronic> not sure a p4 3.2ghz is really designed for a laptop
18:42 <+aeronic> itll burn your bits :)
18:42 <@NeilOfDoom> aeronic :: it's a desktop replacement

18:42 <@Krypt0n> http://students.bath.ac.uk/cs1mis/photos/servercup.jpg
18:42 <@NeilOfDoom> crap battery life, but it's fine as a desktop machine
18:42 <+aeronic> buy an ibm one :)
18:42 <@NeilOfDoom> oh I don't want one
18:42 <+aeronic> :)
18:43 <@NeilOfDoom> I'm going for the alienware, I like it
18:43 <@NeilOfDoom> blue one of course, looks the business :)
18:43 <+Dax|Radiator> lol Krypt
18:43 <+aeronic> id get the 60gig hitachi hdd
18:43 <+aeronic> it'll give good performanc
18:43 <+aeronic> also you want pc3200 ram
18:43 <+aeronic> with a p4
18:43 <@NeilOfDoom> aeronic :: yeah that's what I'll do I think
18:43 <@NeilOfDoom> yes of course
18:43 <@Krypt0n> top to bottom usb adsl modem, house server, ras server, firewall, switch, then two spare pcs
18:43 <@NeilOfDoom> I'm basically going for the top spec
18:44 <+aeronic> also id get the 2.6c and oc it
18:44 <+aeronic> but thats jsut me
18:44 <@NeilOfDoom> can't really
18:44 <@NeilOfDoom> it's already too hot
18:44 <+aeronic> i meant oc it to 3.2ghz
18:44 <+Dax|Radiator> Krypt: why you need separate house, ras servers and firewall?
18:44 <+aeronic> thats same temp as a 3.2ghz cpu
18:44 <+aeronic> so...
18:44 <@NeilOfDoom> not like you can fit extra cooling systems in
18:44 <@NeilOfDoom> oh I see, true
18:44 <+aeronic> saves £150 :)
18:44 <+aeronic> but
18:44 <+aeronic> not a great deal
18:44 <@NeilOfDoom> well on a £2600 laptop that's not much ;)
18:44 <+aeronic> im a very traditional man
18:45 <+aeronic> i like a laptop to be portable
18:45 <+aeronic> and a desktop to be powerful
18:45 <+aeronic> hence i want an ulv centrino
18:45 <+aeronic> or a c3
18:45 <+Dax|Radiator> Cheapest G card is £30 too
18:45 <+aeronic> tiny tiny thing
18:45 <+aeronic> :)
18:45 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: well the "house" server is really just one housemate's main machine, but he didn't want it in his room, the RAS server is really just the same, ie, his machine for connecting to remotely and running x stuff. firewall is separate due to security
18:45 <@NeilOfDoom> well that's not what I'm after
18:45 <+Dax|Radiator> Aero... you got for ultra-portable?
18:45 <+aeronic> que?
18:45 <@NeilOfDoom> I want a very powerful desktop that doesn't need a computer desk
18:45 <@NeilOfDoom> because I don't have space
18:46 <+aeronic> right :)
18:46 <+aeronic> <Dax|Radiator> Aero... you got for ultra-portable? <- what
18:46 <@NeilOfDoom> thought about a shuttle or similar but I may as well just get a laptop
18:46 <+Dax|Radiator> [16:45] <+aeronic> im a very traditional man
18:46 <+Dax|Radiator> [16:45] <+aeronic> i like a laptop to be portable
18:46 <+aeronic> special offer ont he shuttle btw
18:46 <+aeronic> athlon 64 shuttle + cpu
18:46 <+aeronic> for £480
18:46 <+aeronic> the cpu is 360 and shuttle is 250
18:46 <+aeronic> so nice bargain
18:46 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: the firewall is the router, it doesn't run any services other than ssh, limited to come from about 5 ips
18:46 <+aeronic> dax, i like ultra portable laptops
18:46 <+Dax|Radiator> Shuttles are great for lans, but useless if you've got the space for a propper PC
18:47 <+Dax|Radiator> Krypt0n: SOunds like serious overkill to me... :O
18:47 <@Krypt0n> mhh, shuttle. I was looking at them yesterday
18:47 <+Dax|Radiator> sorry I mean lans in the context of lan-parties
18:47 <+aeronic> sn85g = rox

18:49 <@Krypt0n> yeah, but the 802.11b sticks are cute
18:49 <+Dax|Radiator> lool
18:49 <@NeilOfDoom> what's the difference between b and g?
18:49 <+aeronic> 11mbit 54mbit
18:49 <+Dax|Radiator> b = 11
18:49 <+Dax|Radiator> g = 54
18:49 <+aeronic> and better fall-off
18:50 <+Dax|Radiator> yup
18:50 <+Dax|Radiator> g is backwards compatible to b
18:50 <+aeronic> where is it £30
18:50 <+aeronic> OI WHERE
18:50 <+aeronic> :)
18:50 <+Dax|Radiator> a is 54 and upto 108, but not compaitble
18:50 <+Dax|Radiator> aero: pci or pc?
18:50 <+aeronic> pci
18:50 <@Krypt0n> a is better for higher density applications
18:50 <+Dax|Radiator> a sucks :p
18:51 <+aeronic> Pioneer DVR-106 DVD+RW/+R -RW/-R 4 speed IDE OEM (Drive only)

18:51 <@Krypt0n> nah, a is good as it has broader channels, they don't leak onto surrounding ones
18:51 <+Dax|Radiator> aeronic :: http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=45622
18:51 <+aeronic> ew gawds
18:52 <+aeronic> £36
18:52 <+aeronic> not 35
18:52 <+aeronic> not 30 even
18:52 <+Dax|Radiator> £30.32 :P
18:52 <+aeronic> £35.63 inc VAT
18:52 <+Dax|Radiator> oops forgot... I claim back vat
18:52 <+aeronic> fool0r
18:53 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator you what?
18:53 <+Dax|Radiator> prices should never be quoted with vat or deliv anyway :P
18:53 <+aeronic> of course they should
18:53 <+aeronic> so you can make a consumer comparison
18:53 <@Krypt0n> of course they should
18:53 <+aeronic> shop a or shop b
18:53 <+aeronic> lets see who charges more
18:53 <+aeronic> vat + Deliv is essential
18:53 <@Krypt0n> yep
18:54 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator why do you not pay VAT?
18:54 <+Dax|Radiator> Companies don't pay vat
18:55 <+Dax|Radiator> so I order thru company and claim it backl
18:55 <+Dax|Radiator> VAt is by far the most stupid and wasteful tax
18:55 <@Krypt0n> through company? your hosting reselling business?
18:55 <+Dax|Radiator> nah, thru a small computer consultancy firm I've worked for
18:55 <@Krypt0n> i see
18:56 <@Krypt0n> well, companies only don't pay vat when the goods are to be sold on...
18:56 <+Dax|Radiator> no
18:56 <@Krypt0n> yes
18:56 <+Dax|Radiator> companies don't pay vat fullstop
18:56 <@Krypt0n> they do
18:56 <+aeronic> oh yes they do
18:56 <+Dax|Radiator> eh?
18:56 <+aeronic> hence the phrase 'vat deductable'
18:56 <+Dax|Radiator> yes
18:56 <@Krypt0n> i buy a pc from ebuyer, they charge vat
18:57 <+Dax|Radiator> and 'company use' is deductavle
18:57 <+aeronic> indeed it is
18:57 <+aeronic> if theres somethign to deduct it from
18:57 <@Krypt0n> ebuyer buy pc from supplier, supplier charges vat
18:57 <+Dax|Radiator> ebuyer then claim vat back
18:57 <+Dax|Radiator> and then charge it
18:57 <+Dax|Radiator> all done separateluy
18:58 <+Dax|Radiator> if Ebuyer by a pc for their own company use they'd still claim the vat back
18:58 <+Dax|Radiator> as 'vat deductable' :P
18:58 <@Krypt0n> hmm
18:59 <+Dax|Radiator> there is threshold above which all companies must charge vat (and can claim it back)... there is another freshold below which you cannot do that
18:59 <+Dax|Radiator> in between it's down to the company as to whether or not they want to be vat accountable
19:00 <@Krypt0n> yes, above £50,000 turnover you must be vat registered... I don't know the lower bound
19:00 <+Dax|Radiator> well it exists
19:01 <+Dax|Radiator> anyway... I always claim vat back (technically illegally cos it's for personal use)
19:01 <+Dax|Radiator> but only on computer hardware
19:01 <@Krypt0n> and the people at this company don't mind? ie they do enough business to cover it?
19:02 <+Dax|Radiator> so long as it look legitamte they don't care.. it's small fish

19:03 <@NoVisAnima> hey
19:03 <+Burninator> did you go to the lisp lec's last friday (not the one just gone the one before) Dax|Radiator?
19:03 <@NoVisAnima> "kids" oh the irony
19:03 <@Krypt0n> yeah, that's the thing. if you start putting in requests for money from the VAT office they are going to start looking at your books carefully
19:03 <@Krypt0n> LOL
19:03 <@Krypt0n> yeah
19:03  * Burninator burninates Neil|Away
19:03 <@Krypt0n> hello teenager :P
19:03 <+Burninator> erm
19:03 <+Burninator> NoVisAnima
19:03 <@NoVisAnima> yes Burninator
19:03 <+Burninator> whoops
19:03  * Burninator unburninates Neil|Away
19:04 <+Dax|Radiator> Krpton, most companies claim LOADS back every week... so long as I don't do anything stupid, the VAT office will never have any idea
19:04 <@NoVisAnima> heeheh
19:04  * Burninator yawns
19:04 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: yes, but claim back is a academic thing, all it really means is that they take it off their vat payments
19:05 <+Dax|Radiator> I believe that food and petty cash is no covered... and neither are some 'perks' (eg. company yact for private use)
19:05  * NoVisAnima yawns
19:05 <@NoVisAnima> damn person who rang us multiple times at 6 in the morning
19:05 <@NoVisAnima> i was so tired that it ended up being part of my dream
19:05 <+Burninator> woo
19:05 <@NoVisAnima> i swore that it was me setting it off by the 3rd one at 6:30
19:05 <+Dax|Radiator> Krypt: Potentially (and this would be BAD for business) you could claim more VAT back than you have charged for a quarter
19:05 <+Burninator> dont think i dreamt about anything memorable last night
19:07 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: that's what I mean, when I said "if you start putting in requests for money from the VAT office".
19:07 <+Dax|Radiator> Krpy but that would never happen, cos like I said... I've never claimed anything compared with the kind of vat the company deals with
19:07 <@NeilOfDoom> hmm
19:07 <@Krypt0n> my mum has worked for places that have done that, due to cash flow etc. so they make three large payments, then in quater 4 they claimed back loads
19:07 <@NeilOfDoom> I can take the warranty on this laptop from 3 years to 1 year
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> and save £117
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> it's a 24/7 phone warranty
19:08 <+Dax|Radiator> NeilOfDoom u sure that's wise?
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> should I do it
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> ?
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> no I'm not, that's why I'm asking
19:08 <+Dax|Radiator> Lappies are not half as reliable as desktops
19:08 <+Burninator> heh
19:08 <@Krypt0n> Dax|Radiator :: yep, fair enough... share teh wealth, that's what I always say when it comes to fucking hte vat office :D
19:08 <+Burninator> my computer has a crap warranty
19:08 <+Burninator> if it breaks you have to take it back to London
19:08 <+Dax|Radiator> :(
19:08 <+Dax|Radiator> Neil: is this the new one
19:08 <+Dax|Radiator> ?
19:08 <@NeilOfDoom> haven't had a computer warranty in years

19:09 <+aeronic> i like desktops i can fix it myself
19:09 <@NeilOfDoom> Dax|Radiator :: yes the Alienware one I'm looking at
19:09 <@NeilOfDoom> can't buy it until the end of the month anyway

00:42 <+Dax|Telleh> how did you get on resnet?
00:43 <+Krypt0n> was getting 460kB/sec on a bit torrent to, but I decided that getting >400kB/s for 2gigs from america wasn't the wisest idea
00:43 <+Krypt0n> uhh, when you dock, you are essentially on resnet
00:43 <+Dax|Telleh> you're on bucs net aint ya
00:43 <+Dax|Telleh> which is separate from resnet
00:44 <+Krypt0n> nope, docking gives you the same sort of IP as resnet, different samba servers, but you can access resnet pc's, and hence shares, from docking
00:45 <+Dax|Telleh> oh
00:45 <+Dax|Telleh> do you get a machine name of rpc?
00:48 <+Krypt0n> ?
00:49 <+Krypt0n> actually, I saw some second year cs person running a rather fast and good network scanner, aquired a copy for myself and did a search
00:49 <+Dax|Telleh> Languard net scan?
00:50 <+Krypt0n> it searches based on what ever the master browser says is on the network. sometimes it's a lot better than other
00:50 <+Krypt0n> nah, languard is a bit pants
00:50 <+Krypt0n> this is called "Beyond Search"
00:50 <+Dax|Telleh> oooh

22:09 <@NoVisAnima> a public apology does seem to be a sensible option

22:11 <@NoVisAnima> you know that email alwyn sent out was directly aimed at her actions
22:11 <@NoVisAnima> AFAIK nothing on that journal insulted padget
22:11 <@NoVisAnima> i mean she thinks of him as a fluffy guinea pig
22:12 <+BnBKeen> AFAIK?

21:41  * Krypt0n looks around
21:42  * Krypt0n realised earlier that he has exactly 5 hours between now and friday to do any work, then friday, then none until next monday...
21:42 <@Krypt0n> far too much pleasure, not enough work
21:42 <@Krypt0n> hmm, maybe I'll have to skip fencing tomorrow
21:47 <@Krypt0n> Neil|Work :: what did you think of the advanced compilers coursework?
21:54  * Krypt0n cusses not paying CC bill today, and hopes that paying in tomorrow will miss the £20 late payment fine

22:21 <@Krypt0n> fear the work avoidance ownage.
22:22 <@Krypt0n> I've just moved my desk to try and improve the dual pc-age, but it failed, so now i have to move it all back!
22:22 <@NoVisAnima> gah
22:22 <@NoVisAnima> you aren't supposed to be avoiding work
22:25 <@Krypt0n> hmm it almost worka
22:26 <@Krypt0n> if only my corner desk was a bit bigger
22:27  * Krypt0n adjusts, but doesn't like the idea of monitor wedged between desk and wall almost about to slip between them
22:27  * Krypt0n puts it all back the way it was
22:38  * Krypt0n cusses that it's not the same as it was

22:48 <@NoVisAnima> i should have a nice setup here on friday
22:50 <@Krypt0n> here?
22:50 <@Krypt0n> getting new speaker stands then?
22:52 <@NoVisAnima> well that's the idea
22:53 <@NoVisAnima> i doubt they'll find the place

23:04 <@Krypt0n> :( well it doesn't really matter
23:04 <@Krypt0n> wrt compilers, is there a lecutre/class tomorrow?
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> there is a class tomorrow with padget
23:09 <@NoVisAnima> apparently he volunteered to do it without having to be asked, if that's any indication of anything
23:09 <@Krypt0n> hmm, yes, he did, I was there.
23:10 <@NoVisAnima> you were?
23:12 <@Krypt0n> when Padget offered to do the class yes. I'd jsut been talking to them both about the coursework
23:13 <@Krypt0n> it's bad when they double team and start finishing each others explainations!
23:22 <@NoVisAnima> ~:/
23:23 <@NoVisAnima> i haven't seen them double teaming properly
23:25 <@Krypt0n> gah, I don't understand this code! :/

15:15 <+endeavour> :P
15:15 <+endeavour> so what sort of time will this LAN be busy
15:15 <@NoVisAnima> when people turn up
15:15 <@NoVisAnima> that depends on when they wake up
15:15 <@NoVisAnima> ~:P
15:15 <@NoVisAnima> but the best answer would be... yesterday
15:16 <+endeavour> just clicked join on buncs on bathstudent.com
15:16 <@NoVisAnima> dont bother with that
15:16 <+endeavour> does someone need to accept me
15:16 <@NoVisAnima> it's not as if we cba to update that crap
15:16 <+endeavour> i know... but i thought you might use it for mailings
15:16 <@NoVisAnima> oh yeah you're not a member
15:16 <@NoVisAnima> just give me money then
15:16 <@NoVisAnima> it is for mailings
15:17 <+endeavour> k
15:17 <@NoVisAnima> because we're not supposed to be using the mailing list thing
15:17 <@NoVisAnima> as bucs want to get rid of them

15:39 <+Rach|here> how did you know?
15:40 <+endeavour> Since when did hamster have a 'p' in it?
15:40 <@Kamakaze> since it was a hampster
15:40 <+endeavour> wtf is a hampster?
15:40 <@NeilOfDoom> it's like a hamper
15:40 <@NeilOfDoom> but with fur
15:41 <+endeavour> well glad that's cleared up

16:07 <@Kamakaze> that sounds dodgy
16:07 <@GwieF> a finger of fudge is just enough to give your kids a treat
16:07 <+Rach|here> a cadbury's chocolate finger you filthy man
16:08 <+Rach|here> I'll have one if there's one going GwieF
16:08  * NoVisAnima wanders over
16:08 <@GwieF> awww I wanted to pelt you with them
16:09 <+Rach|here> a-ha, summat else we could use to turn on the light#
16:09 <@NoVisAnima> thanks
16:09 <+Rach|here> this is silly
16:09 <@NoVisAnima> how could you waste chocolate fingers on turning lights on?
16:10 <@GwieF> throwing them at you... they might trigger it
16:10 <@Xiven> hang a pendulum in front of the sensor
16:10 <+Rach|here> well they wouldn't be wasted cos you'd get them, we'd chuck them at you and in the process turn on the lights
16:10 <@GwieF> we couold just get novis to dance for us in the middle of the room
16:10 <@NoVisAnima> i dont think the sensor reaches that far out?
16:11 <@NoVisAnima> you think i'm just going to randomly dance for you in the middle of the room?
16:11 <+Rach|here> the pendulum would stop moving due to resistances
16:11 <+Rach|here> or summat
16:11 <+Rach|here> i can't remember
16:11 <@Xiven> true
16:11 <@Kamakaze> get an electric pendulum
16:12 <@GwieF> I prefer the novis dancing idea
16:12 <+Rach|here> me too
16:12 <+Rach|here> motion seconded and carried
16:12 <+Rach|here> dance novis, dance!
16:12 <@GwieF> hes franticly typing but not saying anything in irc

16:52 <+Harbinger> well ive got halo and w3 and wolfenstien:et on my comp atm.
16:52 <+endeavour> yeah we can both google
16:53 <+endeavour> just random equations don't mean a lot
16:53 <+Harbinger> the maths lecturers wud kill u for calling em "random equations" lol ;)
16:53 <@NoVisAnima> yeah there's something useful about actually understanding what they are ment to be doing
16:53 <+Harbinger> so, how has the weekend gaming been so far?
16:54 <+Harbinger> (sos i havnt played yet, ive had coursework to do)
16:54 <@NoVisAnima> well i dont think it's possible to connect to any servers hosted here due to the way we have to connect to the network
16:55 <+Harbinger> how is that? by some kinda backdoor?
16:55 <+endeavour> lol
16:55 <@NoVisAnima> we've only got 1 ip

21:07 <@Kamakaze> WAI?
21:07 <@draq> Is there some GBA + Game combo ?
21:07 <@Xiven> Web Accesibility Initiative?
21:07 <@draq> Web accessibility stuff
21:08 <@Kamakaze> i see
21:08 <@draq> Yes, I am doing a thesis into the topic
21:08 <@Kamakaze> i have no idea what that is
21:08 <@draq> but it i have not cemented the topic thing yet. i.e. not too sure what i am going to do.
21:08 <@Kamakaze> gba + golden sun 1+2, plus advance wars 2
21:08 <@draq> Kamakaze: who should I buy from?

21:08 <@draq> but I wanted to know what were your guys take on it

21:09 <@Xiven> that was for kam's benefit
21:09 <@draq> Kamakaze: Fool
21:09 <@draq> :)
21:09 <@Xiven> my site once was AAA compliant
21:09 <@Xiven> can't be arsed to be that anal though
21:10 <@draq> It's quite hard
21:10 <@Xiven> yep
21:10 <@draq> And I don't understand bobby's output
21:10 <@draq> I am thinking of writing a thesis to encourage people to make "good" web pages

21:10 <@Xiven> bobby outputs a lot of stuff for you to check manually, no matter what, but it will tell you if there's a point you've failed on
21:11 <@draq> I want to reason, or prove that perhaps certain steps are importand and worthwhile. while others not so.
21:11 <@draq> or something like that.
21:11 <@draq> a hypthosis, to prove X amount of work, gives best quality/results
21:11 < Krypt0n> hmm
21:11 <@draq> Kamakaze: who should I buy from? 
21:12 <@draq> But maybe I should keep abstract instead
21:12 <@Kamakaze> buy from who ever you want to really
21:12 <@draq> As it is pretty difficult to get good quantitive data I think.
21:12 < Krypt0n> quantative data for what?
21:14 <@draq> Krypt0n: a thesis. To prove that, for e.g. following a WAI guideline will give better usability or something
21:15 <@draq> I have to prove everything. Be scientific see.
21:15 <@Xiven> some WAI guidelines are stupid
21:16 <@draq> Xiven: ah good. This is what I want to hear. :)
21:16 <@Xiven> like the one that insists that all input boxes should have placeholder values filled in
21:16 <@Xiven> which means that people have to DELETE the contents of the <input> before they can type their own value in
21:17 <@Kamakaze> that sounds silly
21:17 <@Xiven> yes
21:17 <@Kamakaze> the placeholder value is nothing
21:17 <@draq> Proving that people have to delete stuff is stupid. Hmmm
21:17 <@Xiven> hang on and i'll find the guideline
21:18 <@draq> Are you familiar with any EU guidelines ?
21:18 <@Xiven> no
21:18 <@Xiven> only WCAG1.0 and Section508 (US)
21:19 <@Xiven> there may well be some EU guidelines somewhere
21:19 <@draq> Are there stupid things in Section508 ?
21:19 <@Xiven> unsure
21:19 <@Xiven> iirc section508 is a subset of WCAG1.0
21:20 <@Xiven> http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#forms-specific
21:22 <@Xiven> basically it's saying you should inconvenience the vast majority of people to provide support for _extreme_ legacy applications
21:23 <@draq> anything else beside the form stuff?
21:23 <@Xiven> none that i can think of right now

22:06  * draq is confused
22:08 <+Pulpstars> Well I might have to see her in the future at conventions and so forth so I thought I'd try to get us both onto civil terms at least .
22:09 <+Pulpstars> By eating humble pie and apologising for my slightly petty behaviour .
22:13 <+Pulpstars> I thought *can't hold grudges your whole life* so I was attempting to resolve the situation . 
22:15 <+Pulpstars> And I feel I made te right decision , since i believe in life you should try and do the right thing , not whats going to make you look best .

19:47 <@Hixie> i nearly wet my pants when i first ran it
19:47 <@Hixie> been looking for something like that for years
19:47 <@draq> Hixie: There is a 2.0-dev you could try

19:48 <@draq> but seems popular amongst some peeps here
19:48 <@Hixie> it's ok
19:48 <@Hixie> it's just different than what i have now, and i don't want to try to port my config :-)
19:48 <@draq> i am a big python fan
19:49 <@Hixie> python look cool
19:49 <@Hixie> never really used it
19:49  * draq is trying to put his $HOME into subversion
19:49 <@Hixie> heh
19:49 <@draq> do you use encryption on your laptop?
19:49 <@Hixie> that would kill me, i'd run out of disk space overnight
19:49 <@Hixie> nah
19:50 <@Hixie> encryption always seems to get in the way
19:50 <@Hixie> plus everything i do is public anyway
19:50 <@draq> well, I am not putting ~/mp3 and ~/movies in there
19:50 <@Hixie> lol
19:50 <@Hixie> i'd hope not!
19:50  * Hixie puts them in /var/music
19:50 <@Hixie> and photos in /var/photos
19:50 <@draq> /var/music. interesting
19:50 <@draq> it's that LSB? What is /var supposed to be for? :)
19:51 <@Hixie> dunno, but it was the largest partition, so... :-P
19:51 <@Hixie> actually i think it's far VARiable data
19:51 <@Hixie> this whole /var /opt /usr stuff is bollocks anyway
19:51 <@Hixie> should use like /Programs and /Users and stuff
19:52 <+Evo``> /var is generally used for stuff like logs
19:53 <@draq> Well, I think I do want to move those files elsewhere. But there does not seem to be a convention
19:53 <@draq> Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

19:55 <+Evo``> hide them in /usr/bin ;)
19:57 <@Hixie> draq: heh
19:59 <@draq> Hixie: can you give me any pointers to good research papers in your field? Is "research" from Universitys about stuff a resource for you?
20:01 <@Hixie> i don't think i've ever personally referred to research papers in my field (Web standards)
20:01 <@Hixie> so i'd have to say "no"
20:01 <@Hixie> the biggest problem is that by the time the research is done, the topic is obsolete
20:01 <@draq> Hixie: example?
20:01 <@Hixie> i dunno
20:02 <@Hixie> what kind of stuff is research done on?
20:02 <@draq> Hixie: well, I saw some stuff about style sheet languages sometime ago
20:02 <@Hixie> ah. haven't seen that.
20:02 <@draq> Hixie: some guy critisizing it. But I thought he was wrong :)
20:02 <@Hixie> uri?
20:02 <@draq> Hixie: hmmm, IEEE stuff is subscriber only
20:03 <@draq> :/
20:03 <@Hixie> heh
20:03 <@Hixie> that'd be why i haven't seen it then
20:03 <@draq> Indeed. Little flawed this whole research stuff is.
20:03 <@Hixie> heh
20:03 <@Hixie> ok, then i'd say this:
