18:45 -!- Irssi: Starting query in quakenet with Kamakaze
18:45 <draq> can i bother you about some C questions ?
18:46 <Kamakaze> i guess
18:46 <Kamakaze> but i cant say i can answer them
18:47 <draq> i have the multi-dim array that I want to use in several functions
18:47 <draq> int g[ROW][COL];
18:47 <draq> now, I send it to a fun to populate the table, like this :
18:47 <draq> compute_goto(oneword, &g);
18:48 <draq> is that correct?
18:48 <Kamakaze> hmm
18:48 <Kamakaze> well
18:48 <Kamakaze> possibly
18:48 <Kamakaze> but g is already a pointer i think
18:49 <Kamakaze> since int *g
18:49 <Kamakaze> is sort of the same as int g[ROW]
18:49 <Kamakaze> except u are assigning some memory for the array
18:51 <draq> then:
18:51 <draq> void compute_goto(char *word, int *g[][26])
18:51 <draq> but i am not sure about how to pass multi-dim arrays
18:51 <draq> narg...
18:52 <Kamakaze> u just pass the pointer
18:52 <Kamakaze> void compute_goto(char *word, int *g)
18:52 <Kamakaze> then in that function u can just use g[ROW][COL] i think
18:53 <Kamakaze> so long as u know what size the array is so that u dont over shoot the array
18:55 <draq> I am getting this error:
18:55 <draq> main.c:42: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer
18:55 <draq> printf("g: %d\n", g[0][0]);
18:55 <draq> that's in compute_goto
18:56 <Kamakaze> ok what are u passing that function?
18:56 <Kamakaze> can u put the code somewhere all that function and where its called from?
18:59 <draq> http://kiv.ath.cx/~hendry/main.c
19:00 <draq> I would like to size the g thing dynamically, as it won't have so many values...
19:01 <draq> but, i thought i could deal with that element of C later.
19:02 <Kamakaze> well
19:02 <Kamakaze> thats more of a pointer thing
19:03 <Kamakaze> firstly
19:03 <Kamakaze> remove the & from the &g
19:03 <Kamakaze> u are passing the address of a pointer
19:03 <Kamakaze> since its already a pointer
19:03 <Kamakaze> that is rather silly
19:03 <draq> that was just a desperate attempt... :)
19:04 <draq> line 77 cleaned up then
19:04 <Kamakaze> well i usually randomly change things to make them work
19:04 <Kamakaze> so i dont really know what im talking about
19:04 <draq> I think if your reload the url, you will see i edited
19:07 <Kamakaze> try
19:07 <Kamakaze> int **g;
19:08 <draq> main.c:77: warning: passing arg 2 of `compute_goto' from incompatible pointer type
19:14 <Kamakaze> ok
19:14 <Kamakaze> in the function protoype
19:14 <Kamakaze> and the function itself
19:14 <Kamakaze> make it
19:14 <Kamakaze> int g[ROW][COL]
19:14 <Kamakaze> then just pass g
19:16 <draq> still the same problem? 
19:16 <draq> warning: passing arg 2 of `compute_goto' from incompatible pointer type
19:16 <Kamakaze> well it works for me
19:18 <draq> and compilation ?
19:18 <draq> and running?
19:18 <draq> mine seg faults
19:18 <Kamakaze> well it compiles

19:19 <draq> shit
19:20 <Kamakaze> well
19:20 <Kamakaze> 2 of those lines commented out
19:20 <Kamakaze> uncommenting
19:21 <Kamakaze> it still works
19:21 <Kamakaze> although im using visual C++
19:22 <draq> so basically it is 0 0 is set to five? and prints down on line 80 too ?

21:38 <draq> CSS stuff
21:38 <draq> :)
21:39 <draq> how do I select the span date in a div class?
21:39 <draq> how do I select the span date in a div class "event" ?
21:39 <draq> .event.date does not work
21:40 <Kamakaze> div.event span.date
21:40 <Kamakaze> or i guess .event .date would work
21:41 <draq> oh yes
21:41 <draq> thanks
21:41 <draq> where do i find basic css for a left menu arrangement?
21:41 <draq> I want to convert http://www.helsinki.fi/hyy/esn/eng/events.html into css
