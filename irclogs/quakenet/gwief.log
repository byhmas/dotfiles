22:05 -!- Irssi: Starting query in quakenet with GwieF
22:05 <GwieF> lo
22:05 <GwieF> yeah I did
22:05 <GwieF> well do you have a decent fleet and are able to defend yourself?
22:06 <GwieF> as I am under attack, by both astat and cartman simultaneously... so i you joined my alliance and I lose (looking likely tbh) then you would be next
22:10 <GwieF> if you have sufficient stuff to help defeat cartman then we may win if we jioned forces
22:11 <draq> I have nothing atm
22:11 <draq> But I could build Thor's hammer and start pissing off Cartman?
22:13 <GwieF> probably not a good idea :)
22:13 <GwieF> as he his fleet is just a few sectors away from your space  and it has bombard ships
22:17 <draq> Well, I could distract him while you build up?
22:17 <draq> Believe me I am worse than Kam when it comes to distracting
22:18 <draq> Well, I have no idea how easy it is to kill someone in this game...
22:19 <GwieF> apart from his fleet and stations (which you need a decent fleet to kill) the only way to distract him is to have bombard capable ships and a fleet and destroy planets.. you could fly around his space with fighters and appart from maybe destroying a constuction ship or 2 he really wouldn't care
22:21 <GwieF> my best advice is build lots of planetary defences and shields on your planets so you won't make a good target at this point
