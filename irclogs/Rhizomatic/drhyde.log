15:38 -!- Irssi: Starting query in Rhizomatic with DrHyde
15:38 <Kai> does MT have to be installed for each account? I would like to possibly use it on prazefarm.co.uk and rossetti.org.uk ?
15:40 <Kai> Oh well. I will figure it out...
15:44 <DrHyde> yes, you'll need to put it in your web site's directory.

16:06 <DrHyde> the connection is slow or it executes slowly?
16:07 <Kai> Can't really tell. 
16:09 <DrHyde> how fast can you upload/download static content?
16:09 <DrHyde> should be able to send to plough at up to 50-something Kbytes/s
16:09 <DrHyde> and receive from it at about half that

16:16 <Kai> I think it is to do with the connection really. Narg.

18:14 <DrHyde> analog is installed so you can run your own reports on that data
18:16 <DrHyde> the default configuration for analog is to run my stats, so you'll need to either point it at your own config file or give it all the options on the command line
